How do you power 2+ GW of AI compute without bringing down the grid?

I just published my most comprehensive technical paper yet: a deep dive into how AWS, Google, Microsoft, xAI, and Anthropic are redesigning power distribution from the ground up.

Key insights:

- AWS eliminated centralized UPS entirely - 35% efficiency gain, 89% fewer affected racks during failures
- Google deploys 100M+ Li-ion cells at server level - achieving 1.09 PUE
- xAI Colossus consumes 2 GW in Memphis - 40% of the city's daily energy
- Anthropic's multi-cloud strategy spans 4 providers, 6+ states, 2.3 GW+ capacity
- 800V DC architecture reduces copper by 16.7x vs traditional 48V

The paper covers:
- Failure scenario analysis (15 scenarios with RTO)
- Cascading failure propagation paths
- Protection coordination per NEC/IEEE standards
- Grid interconnection across MISO, SPP, PJM, ERCOT
- Reliability calculations: how multi-cloud achieves 99.99%

15,000+ words. 15 detailed subsections on Anthropic alone.

If you're designing, operating, or investing in AI infrastructure - this is the technical foundation you need.
