The HVAC Shock: "No Chillers" Doesn't Mean "No Cooling"

NVIDIA's announcement sent HVAC stocks tumbling.

"Rubin architecture uses direct liquid cooling - no chillers needed."

The market reaction was swift. But here's what most missed:

"No chillers" does NOT mean "no cooling infrastructure."

The Technical Reality:

Even with direct liquid cooling (DLC):
- Heat still needs to be rejected somewhere
- Dry coolers, cooling towers, or hybrid systems required
- Heat exchangers, CDUs, pumps all needed
- Water/glycol loops still circulate

What changes:
- Compressor-based chillers often eliminated
- PUE improves dramatically (1.1-1.2 achievable)
- Water usage CAN decrease (with dry coolers)
- But tropical climates face unique challenges

The Tropical Climate Challenge:

At 35C ambient and 80% humidity (Jakarta, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur):
- Dry coolers alone insufficient
- Hybrid approach often required
- Evaporative assist may be needed
- Water-cooled backup still valuable

Fault Scenario Analysis:

What happens when cooling fails with 100kW/rack GPU clusters?
- Thermal runaway timeline: 2-4 minutes
- No passive thermal mass like air-cooled
- Redundancy requirements increase

I've compiled a comprehensive technical analysis:
- Free cooling feasibility by climate zone
- PUE improvement calculations
- Fault scenario timelines
- Tropical implementation guide
