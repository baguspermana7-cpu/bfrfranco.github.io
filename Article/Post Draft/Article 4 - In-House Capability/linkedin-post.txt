Your vendor SLA says 4-hour response. But what does that actually mean at 2 AM on a holiday weekend?

I spent three years tracking 428 critical incidents at a 10MW colocation facility. When I decomposed MTTR into five discrete phases -- Detection, Diagnosis, Mobilization, Repair, Verification -- the results were hard to ignore.

Vendor mobilization accounted for 59% of total MTTR. Not the technical repair. Not the diagnosis. Just the time waiting for someone to show up.

The average vendor MTTR was 6.75 hours. The in-house equivalent? 2.60 hours. A 61% reduction, driven almost entirely by eliminating that mobilization bottleneck.

And the 95th percentile for P1 vendor response stretched to 7.8 hours -- meaning 1 in 20 critical incidents doubled the contracted SLA. Weekend and holiday responses were 2.3x slower than weekday business hours. Critical infrastructure does not observe business hours. That mismatch is a structural reliability risk.

Here is what most people get wrong about vendor dependency: it is not a cost problem. It is a competence erosion problem. Every time your team calls the vendor instead of investigating, they lose a learning opportunity. Over time, operators learn to recognize alarms but not to diagnose root causes. Peter Senge called this "shifting the burden" -- the symptomatic solution undermines the fundamental one.

The ICB framework (Assess, Train, Equip, Certify, Practice) changed our approach. After implementing a four-tier capability layering model, 80% of incidents were resolved at Tier 1 or Tier 2 without any vendor involvement. Vendor callouts dropped from 36 per year to 7.

The financial case: a $50,000 annual investment in capability building generated net savings exceeding $400,000 through reduced downtime and avoided callouts. Training ROI exceeded 1,145%.

But the real shift was organizational. Technicians who troubleshoot complex failures develop adaptive capacity. They carry site-specific knowledge as ambient awareness rather than something that needs to be briefed to a stranger on a call. And paradoxically, the vendor relationship improved -- when your team engages as technical peers instead of dependent clients, vendor engineers provide better service.

In-house capability is not a budget line item. It is a reliability strategy.
