The bullwhip effect is the most dangerous dynamic in SEA data centers right now.

2023-24: Hyperscalers announce massive AI capex.
2024-25: Colo operators start 18-36 month builds.
2026-28: New supply arrives.
2027-29: If AI efficiency outpaces demand, supply hits weakening markets.

Analysts flag 2027-2029 as the correction window. Occupancy peaks late 2026, then moderates.

Not a uniform bubble. Selective by market and operator type.
