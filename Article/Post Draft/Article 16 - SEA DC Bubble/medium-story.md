# The Great SEA Data Center Bubble: When $37 Billion Bets on a Promise

6,068 MW of new capacity. $37 billion invested. Johor's 5.8 GW gamble. Indonesia at 1,717 MW and climbing. I spent weeks digging through Cushman and Wakefield reports, Arizton forecasts, CBRE market data, and public financial filings to answer one question: is Southeast Asia building the infrastructure of the future, or repeating the telecom crash of 2001?

The answer is uncomfortable. It is both.

## The Supply Explosion

Between 2024 and 2026, Southeast Asia witnessed the largest wave of data center investment in its history. The numbers tell a story of ambition that borders on recklessness: 135 upcoming facilities joining 290 existing ones, involving 149 major operators and investors, with a combined pipeline exceeding 6 GW of IT power capacity.

Singapore remains the tightest market, with roughly 780 MW operational and just 2% vacancy. That part of the equation is healthy. The concern is everywhere else.

Malaysia, specifically Johor, has gone from near-zero data center presence five years ago to a 5.8 GW total pipeline. That includes 487 MW operational, 422 MW under construction, 1.4 GW committed with land and power secured, and 3.4 GW in early-stage planning. For a state of 3.8 million people.

Indonesia has reached approximately 1,717 MW of installed capacity, with Jakarta retaining 56.7% of national capacity. Thailand has jumped from roughly 200 MW to a pipeline targeting 1,092 MW by 2030. Vietnam and the Philippines are earlier in their curves but accelerating.

The math that should concern everyone: Johor's 5.8 GW pipeline is 12 times its current operational capacity. Even at an aggressive 20% annual absorption rate, it would take until 2035 or later to fill. Much of this capacity is carrier-neutral and speculative, with tenants not yet secured.

## Indonesia: The 1,717 MW Frontier

Indonesia's data center market is the largest in Southeast Asia by installed capacity. The geography of investment is shifting rapidly from central Jakarta toward Greater Jakarta's industrial corridors in Bekasi, Cibitung, Cikarang, and Karawang.

The most visible indicator of Indonesia's market health is its only publicly listed pure-play data center operator. With a portfolio spanning three campuses, including 73 MW at Cibitung, 27 MW at Karawang, and 19 MW at Jakarta CBD, this operator provides rare transparency in an otherwise opaque market. The financials are exceptional: revenue up 36% year-over-year in 2024, Q1 2025 revenue up 119% year-over-year, and a net income margin of 54%.

But the operator has disclosed plans for a facility in Bintan with projected capacity exceeding 1,000 MW. That represents an eight to ten billion dollar capex commitment over the next decade. The question investors should ask: can a company generating roughly 3 trillion rupiah in annual revenue fund this without massive dilution or debt? And who are the pre-committed tenants for a 1,000 MW facility on an island?

Jakarta's power infrastructure adds another layer of risk. PLN's transmission backbone is near saturation. Data center bookings are forecast to absorb 2,200 MW by 2030, more than one-third of PLN's incremental substation additions. New substations take 2-3 years to commission, and operators in Bekasi and Cikarang are already competing for limited transformer capacity.

## Johor: Boom or Bubble?

No market in Southeast Asia demands more scrutiny than Johor.

The bull case is real. Proximity to Singapore at roughly 2 milliseconds fiber latency makes Johor a natural overflow market for the world's tightest data center hub. Land costs are a fraction of Singapore's. Microsoft has committed $2.2 billion. AWS has committed $6 billion by 2037. Google is active. Malaysia's data center capacity is set to double by end of 2026, according to Nikkei Asia.

The bear case is equally real. Much carrier-neutral capacity is speculative, with tenants not yet secured. 3.4 GW of the 5.8 GW pipeline consists of early-stage projects. Power infrastructure may not keep pace. And sources close to the Johor state government indicate discussions about potential limits on new data center approvals.

Here is the math that matters: AWS's $6 billion investment in Malaysia spans 15 years. That works out to approximately $400 million per year. Microsoft's $2.2 billion is over four years. These are not lump-sum capacity injections. They are gradual deployments that the 5.8 GW pipeline dramatically outpaces.

## The Hyperscaler Dependency Trap

An estimated 60-70% of new large-scale builds in SEA are build-to-suit or pre-leased to hyperscalers. The remaining 30-40% are speculative, carrier-neutral builds hoping to attract tenants post-construction. This creates a dangerous concentration of risk.

While colocation providers build for hyperscalers, the hyperscalers themselves are quietly building their own facilities. Microsoft has self-build data centers under development in Cyberjaya. Google has a self-build facility in northern Kuala Lumpur. AWS has self-build operations across Singapore with a $17 billion commitment. The playbook is clear: use colocation for speed-to-market, then progressively shift workloads to owned infrastructure where economics favor it. Every megawatt of self-build capacity is a megawatt that will not be leased from a colocation provider.

Hyperscaler capex is projected at $602 billion in 2026, a 36% increase over 2025, with 75% directed to AI infrastructure. The Big Five now spend 45-57% of revenue on capex, ratios historically associated with overinvestment. They have raised $108 billion in debt in 2025 alone to fund this expansion.

Goldman Sachs has compared the projected $3 trillion in AI infrastructure investment by 2028 to the railroad build-out of the 1800s in scale. That comparison should give everyone pause.

## The Stranded Assets Nobody Talks About

While billions pour into new AI-ready facilities, a quieter crisis unfolds in the region's older data centers. Pre-2015 facilities designed for 5-10 kW per rack are fundamentally incompatible with modern AI workloads demanding 50-100 kW per rack. The gap extends to cooling, from raised-floor CRAC systems to direct liquid cooling. Floor loading must quadruple. PUE sits at 1.8-2.5 versus 1.2-1.3 for modern builds.

Legacy facilities face a dual compression. Their existing enterprise tenants migrate to cloud, while hyperscaler and AI tenants exclusively target purpose-built, AI-ready facilities. Retrofitting from 5 kW to 15-20 kW per rack is feasible at roughly $5-6 million per MW, but reaching true AI-ready density above 50 kW per rack is impractical in most pre-2015 buildings.

A telling signal: SM Investments Corporation, one of the Philippines' largest conglomerates, announced in late 2025 it was exiting the data center business entirely, citing soaring electricity costs and heightened disaster risks. When a diversified conglomerate cannot make data center economics work, smaller operators face existential questions.

## Is This a Bubble?

To answer this honestly, I examined the historical parallels.

The telecom fiber boom of 1996-2000 saw companies lay enough fiber to circle the earth 1,500 times. By 2001, less than 3% was lit. Total losses exceeded $2 trillion. The infrastructure eventually proved valuable, but most original investors lost everything.

The US data center overbuild of 2007-2009 saw speculative construction in Northern Virginia, Chicago, and Dallas outpace demand. Vacancy rates spiked to 20-30%. Multiple operators went bankrupt or were acquired at distressed valuations. Recovery took 3-4 years.

China's data center ghost towns from 2015-2020 saw massive parks built in Inner Mongolia and Guizhou with government subsidies. Many sat empty or severely underutilized.

Looking at a bubble indicators scorecard for the SEA market in 2026, I count four strong bubble signals: supply outpacing demand, the "this time is different" narrative, new entrants flooding in from real estate and private equity, and dangerous customer concentration on hyperscalers. Two moderate signals emerge for speculative building and easy financing. But there are also two healthy counter-signals: demand is actually materializing with 119% revenue growth at Indonesia's listed operator, and structural demand drivers from AI, cloud, and digital transformation are real.

## The Bullwhip Effect

The bullwhip effect, where supply decisions lag demand signals and cause amplified boom-bust cycles, is the most dangerous dynamic in the current market. Hyperscalers announced massive AI investments in 2023-2024. Colocation operators began 18-36 month construction cycles in 2024-2025. New supply comes online 2-3 years after the demand signal. If AI capex decelerates or efficiency improves in the interim, supply arrives into weakening demand during 2027-2029.

Analysts at Gadallon Research explicitly warn of periods of overcapacity and unstable pricing for multiple years as the bullwhip unwinds, with mid-decade identified as a potential inflection point. Occupancy rates are projected to peak above 95% in late 2026, followed by moderation starting 2027.

## What Happens When the Music Stops

Based on the evidence, here is the most likely correction scenario. Late 2026 sees occupancy peak as the current pipeline absorbs pent-up demand. In 2027, massive new supply comes online across Johor, Thailand, and Indonesia, and vacancy begins rising. Through 2027-2028, pricing pressure mounts as operators compete for tenants, with speculative builds particularly affected. In 2028-2029, a consolidation wave hits. Smaller and subscale operators are acquired or exit. Legacy data centers face accelerated obsolescence. By 2029-2030, the market stabilizes at a new equilibrium, with survivors emerging stronger.

## The Verdict

This is not a uniform bubble across all SEA markets. Singapore at 2% vacancy with strict government controls is undersupplied and will remain so through 2028. Indonesia has strong domestic demand, and power infrastructure constraints will self-regulate growth. Vietnam is early-stage with genuine structural demand.

The bubble is concentrated in Johor with its 5.8 GW pipeline for 3.8 million people, in parts of Thailand with its 20x investment jump in six months, and among speculative carrier-neutral operators building without anchor tenants. The 2027-2029 correction will be real, but it will be geographic and operator-specific, not a market-wide collapse.

Operators with secured power and pre-committed anchor tenants will survive. Speculative builders without signed letters of intent and legacy data centers relying on declining VPS revenue will not.

The infrastructure being built will eventually prove valuable. But as the fiber-optic crash of 2001 taught us: the infrastructure can be right while the investment timing is catastrophically wrong.

I built an interactive Bubble Risk Calculator that lets you model supply-demand dynamics for any SEA market. You can adjust absorption rates, speculative build percentages, hyperscaler pre-commitment levels, and financial parameters to see how different scenarios affect vacancy projections and investment outcomes.
