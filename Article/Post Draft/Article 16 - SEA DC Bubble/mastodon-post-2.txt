The hyperscaler dependency trap in SEA data centers:

60-70% of new large builds are pre-leased to hyperscalers. But those same hyperscalers are quietly self-building. Microsoft in Cyberjaya. Google in KL. AWS with $17B in Singapore.

Every self-built MW is one that will not be leased from a colo provider.

Meanwhile, legacy DCs at 5-10 kW/rack cannot serve AI at 50-100 kW/rack. Dual compression: losing tenants to cloud AND unable to attract new ones.
