I spent weeks analyzing whether Southeast Asia's data center boom is a generational infrastructure opportunity or a $37 billion bubble.

The numbers forced me to an uncomfortable conclusion: it is both.

Here is what I found.

Southeast Asia now has 6,068 MW of new data center capacity in the pipeline, backed by $37 billion in committed investment. Johor, Malaysia alone has a 5.8 GW pipeline for a state of 3.8 million people. Indonesia has reached 1,717 MW of installed capacity with operators racing to build ahead of demand.

These are extraordinary figures. But when I compared them to actual absorption rates, the picture changed.

Johor's 5.8 GW is 12 times its current operational capacity. At an aggressive 20% annual absorption rate, filling that pipeline takes until 2035. AWS's $6 billion Malaysia commitment spans 15 years, roughly $400 million per year. Microsoft's $2.2 billion is spread over four years. These are gradual deployments, not lump-sum injections.

The hyperscaler dependency creates a concentrated risk. An estimated 60-70% of large new builds are pre-leased to hyperscalers. The remaining 30-40% are speculative, carrier-neutral builds with no anchor tenants. Meanwhile, hyperscalers are quietly building their own facilities. Microsoft in Cyberjaya. Google in northern KL. AWS across Singapore with $17 billion committed. Every self-built megawatt is one that will not be leased from a colocation provider.

The legacy data center problem compounds this. Pre-2015 facilities at 5-10 kW per rack cannot support AI workloads at 50-100 kW per rack. Retrofitting to those densities is impractical. These operators face a dual squeeze: losing enterprise tenants to cloud while unable to attract hyperscaler tenants.

But this is not a uniform story.

Singapore at 2% vacancy is undersupplied and will remain so through 2028. Indonesia's 280 million people and data sovereignty laws create genuine domestic demand. Vietnam is early-stage with structural tailwinds.

The bubble is concentrated in specific markets and among specific operator types. Johor's speculative pipeline, Thailand's rapid buildout, and carrier-neutral operators without anchor tenants carry the most risk.

The historical parallels are instructive. The telecom fiber boom of 1996-2000 destroyed $2 trillion in value. China's data center ghost towns from 2015-2020 are still underutilized. The bullwhip effect, where supply decisions lag demand signals by 2-3 years, could trigger a correction in 2027-2029.

My assessment: four strong bubble signals, two moderate, and two healthy counter-signals. A selective bubble, not a market-wide one.

The infrastructure will eventually prove valuable. But the investment timing may not.

I built an interactive Bubble Risk Calculator where you can model any SEA market with real data. Full analysis with data tables, historical parallels, and the calculator linked below.
