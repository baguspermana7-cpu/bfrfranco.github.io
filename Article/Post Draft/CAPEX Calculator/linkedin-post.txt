A 10 MW data center can cost anywhere from $80M to $200M+ depending on cooling architecture, redundancy tier, seismic zone, and location. Most preliminary cost models quietly ignore half these variables.

I built a CAPEX Calculator that produces a structured construction cost estimate in under 60 seconds. Not a construction bid -- a defensible starting point for business case development and vendor quote validation.

What you can configure:

- IT load capacity (100 kW to 100 MW)
- 4 cooling architectures (Air, In-Row, RDHX, DLC)
- Redundancy tiers (N, N+1, 2N, 2N+1)
- Building type with cost factors (warehouse conversion through high-rise)
- 5 seismic zones with structural cost impact
- 7 location markets with regional adjustments
- Fire suppression, detection, UPS, and generator options

The output breaks down costs across land/site, civil works, electrical, mechanical, fire protection, IT infrastructure, and soft costs -- with per-MW benchmarking.

Premium features include scenario comparison (save Scenario A, modify inputs, compare B), inflation-adjusted projections, and full per-component cost visibility.

Free, browser-based, no data transmitted.

Use it to sanity-check vendor quotes, benchmark across regions, or build a rough business case before committing capital.
