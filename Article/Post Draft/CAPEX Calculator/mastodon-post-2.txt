Cooling architecture is one of the biggest CAPEX variables. Air cooling has the lowest construction cost but highest operating cost. Direct liquid cooling costs more to build but supports 30+ kW/rack densities required by AI workloads.

The CAPEX Calculator lets you compare 4 cooling architectures and see how each affects total construction cost and per-MW benchmarks.
