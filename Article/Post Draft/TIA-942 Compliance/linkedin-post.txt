TIA-942 compliance audits shouldn't require a spreadsheet, three consultants, and a prayer.

If you've ever tried to assess a data center against ANSI/TIA-942-B, you know the pain. The standard spans six separate infrastructure domains. Requirements shift depending on which tier level you're targeting. And the relative criticality of each item is never equal -- missing a UPS redundancy requirement carries far more risk than missing a labeling standard, but most checklists treat them the same.

I built a free tool that fixes this.

The TIA-942 Compliance Checklist evaluates 56 items across all six domains defined in the standard:

-- Site & Architecture (10 items): floor load capacity, ceiling height, raised floor, cable pathways, entrance rooms, vapor barriers
-- Electrical (14 items): utility feeds, UPS redundancy (N+1 through 2N), generators, ATS, PDU distribution, EPO, grounding
-- Mechanical/Cooling (9 items): dedicated CRAC/CRAH units, N+1 and 2N cooling, ASHRAE temperature monitoring, humidity control, leak detection
-- Telecommunications (9 items): entrance rooms, MDA/HDA distribution areas, TIA-568 cabling, fiber backbone, redundant pathways
-- Fire Protection (7 items): VESDA smoke detection, clean agent suppression (FM-200/Novec 1230), pre-action sprinklers, egress
-- Physical Security (7 items): electronic access control, CCTV, man-trap entry, biometric authentication, 24/7 NOC monitoring

Filter by any of the four tier levels -- from Tier 1 Basic up through Tier 4 Fault Tolerant -- and the checklist dynamically adjusts to show only the items applicable to your target.

What makes it different from a static PDF checklist: every item carries a weight (W1 Standard, W2 Important, W3 Critical), and category importance factors (Electrical at 1.5x, Mechanical at 1.3x, Fire Protection at 1.1x) reflect the real-world criticality hierarchy. The overall score accounts for both item completion and category balance.

Grades range from A+ (95%+) down to F (below 50%), with a maturity model from L1 Initial through L5 Optimized.

Pro mode adds gap analysis with prioritized remediation, Monte Carlo risk simulation (10,000 iterations), multi-tier radar comparison, sensitivity analysis, remediation roadmap with cost estimates, and PDF export.
