Jensen Huang said "no water chillers are necessary for data centres" at CES 2026. Within hours, Johnson Controls dropped 7.5%, Trane fell 5.3%, and $1.7 billion in HVAC market cap vanished.

The market heard "no cooling." That is not what he said.

I spent weeks pulling apart what Nvidia actually announced with their Vera Rubin platform and what it means for facility operators. Here is what most people got wrong:

Rubin uses warm-water, single-phase direct liquid cooling at 45 degrees C supply temperature. That is hot enough for dry coolers to reject heat without mechanical refrigeration in Stockholm or Frankfurt. It works because physics works -- when your ambient temperature stays below 35 degrees C, a dry cooler with 5 degrees C approach temperature can handle the load.

But data centers do not only exist in Scandinavia.

In Jakarta, where I work, ambient temperatures hit 35 to 40 degrees C regularly. Humidity sits at 75-85%. The math breaks down fast. A 45 degrees C supply with a 40 degrees C ambient gives you a 5 degree margin on a good day and zero margin during a heat wave. Singapore gets about 400 hours of free cooling per year, which is 4.5% of annual hours. Stockholm gets 7,500 hours, or 86%.

The article breaks down the real trade-offs:

- DLC captures 70-80% of heat at the source through cold plates, but the remaining 20-30% still needs air handling
- Liquid cooling thermal runaway happens 3-5x faster than air cooling -- you have 30-45 seconds to respond instead of 8-15 minutes
- Tropical deployments need 40-50% chiller backup capacity, not zero
- Short-term OPEX savings of 30-60% on cooling energy are real, but initial CAPEX runs $500-2,000 per kW
- The business case for high-density AI racks above 30kW delivers 2-3 year payback, while standard enterprise loads below 10kW stretch to 5-7 years

The real story is not that cooling disappears. The bottleneck shifts from the chiller plant to the CDU, the pumps, the control loops, and the commissioning process. The heat still has to go somewhere.

For operators in tropical climates, the answer is hybrid -- target 60-70% chiller-free operation with robust backup, invest in faster monitoring systems, and train teams on failure modes they have never seen before.
