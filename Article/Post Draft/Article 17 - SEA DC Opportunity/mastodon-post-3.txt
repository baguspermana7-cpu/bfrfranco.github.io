65% of data center demand through 2030 requires only 3-15 kW/rack.

Enterprise IT, cloud, edge, CDN, government workloads. Not every workload needs 100 kW AI-density racks.

Meanwhile, AI inference projected at 90 GW by 2030 must be LOCAL. Every Indonesian AI app user needs inference in Indonesia.

The bubble narrative miscounts demand by at least 60%.
