Jevons Paradox is the most powerful argument against the SEA data center bubble narrative.

DeepSeek cut AI training cost by 95%. Bears said infrastructure demand would fall.

What happened: Meta raised capex to $65B. Amazon to $200B. Microsoft held at $80B.

Cheaper AI = more users, more models, more use cases. Per-unit cost drops 90%, total volume rises 1,000%.

Every efficiency gain the bears cite as evidence AGAINST DC demand is evidence FOR it.
