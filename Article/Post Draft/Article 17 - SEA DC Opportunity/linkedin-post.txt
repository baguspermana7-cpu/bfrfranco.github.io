Last week I published the bear case for Southeast Asia's data center boom. $37 billion invested. 6,068 MW of pipeline. Johor's 5.8 GW gamble.

This week I present the contrarian view. And the data changed my perspective.

The bubble narrative contains a fatal flaw: it extrapolates future demand from past absorption rates. That is like forecasting smartphone demand in 2010 based on flip-phone sales. The demand drivers for 2026-2030 are categorically different.

Start with Jevons Paradox. When DeepSeek showed AI training could be done for $5.6 million instead of $100 million, bears said infrastructure demand would collapse. The opposite happened. Meta raised AI spending to $65 billion. Amazon doubled down to $200 billion. Cheaper AI does not reduce demand. It multiplies it. Per-unit costs drop 90%, but total volume increases 1,000%.

Then consider the demand the bears do not count.

Southeast Asia has 700 million people with a digital economy growing from $300 billion to $1 trillion by 2030. Enterprise cloud adoption is at 25-35%, compared to 60-70% in the US. That migration wave has not started for many sectors.

Six nations have enacted sovereign AI mandates requiring local data infrastructure. Indonesia targets $140 billion GDP from AI by 2030. Malaysia allocated RM 2 billion for sovereign AI cloud. These are legally mandated requirements, not commercial projections. Conservative estimates put sovereign demand at 1,500-2,000 MW by 2030, completely invisible in commercial pipeline analyses.

The inference economy changes the entire equation. AI inference is projected at 75% of all AI compute by 2030, growing at 35% CAGR to 90 GW globally. Unlike training, inference must be local. Every Indonesian using an AI app needs inference capacity in Indonesia. This creates distributed demand that cannot be centralized.

And 65% of data center demand through 2030 sits at 3-15 kW per rack. The legacy facilities the bear case writes off as stranded assets are positioned for the majority of the market.

The Northern Virginia parallel is instructive. In 2012, Ashburn was called overbuilt. Today it has 2,000 MW, sub-2% vacancy, and turns away new builds. The decade of oversupply lasted 18 months before cloud adoption inflected.

Smart money is not pulling out. Blackstone has committed $70 billion to data center infrastructure. GIC, Brookfield, and KKR are accelerating SEA exposure. AirTrunk sold for $16.1 billion, the largest private infrastructure deal in APAC history.

Not every project will succeed. A correction for the weakest operators in 2027-2029 is probable. But the structural thesis is sound.

The bears are counting known demand against known supply. That demand represents perhaps 30-40% of what actually materializes by 2030. They are measuring the tip of an iceberg and declaring the ocean shallow.
