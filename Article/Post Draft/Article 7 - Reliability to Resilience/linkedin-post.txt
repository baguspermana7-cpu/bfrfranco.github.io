A Tier III certified data center experienced a cascading outage that took down 15% of client loads for 31 minutes. Every component worked as designed. The design was not the problem.

Here is what actually happened: A voltage sag triggered a normal UPS transfer. UPS-A recovered fine. UPS-B had a capacitor degradation issue that went undetected because maintenance was delayed three weeks due to staffing constraints. The BMS alarm got buried in 47 active notifications because nobody had done an alarm rationalization pass. The on-duty operator was new and covering for the regular shift lead. When UPS-B batteries depleted after 14 minutes, the static bypass tripped on a known issue that sat in a maintenance report for six months without being escalated.

The facility was still a legitimate Tier III. But its operational resilience was nowhere near Tier III.

This pattern repeats across the industry. Uptime Institute data shows that 60-80% of all data center outages are caused by human error, process failures, or organizational factors. Not equipment failures. The Tier system evaluates topology, and it does that well. But it says nothing about how fast your team responds to alarms, whether your documentation matches reality, or if your operators have practiced compound failure scenarios.

I wrote about this gap in detail and proposed a 7-dimension resilience assessment framework grounded in Hollnagel's resilience engineering principles. The seven dimensions: drill frequency, response capability, recovery testing, cross-training coverage, documentation currency, communication planning, and lessons learned maturity. Each one is weighted and scored to produce a Resilience Score that you can compare against your design-based Reliability Score.

The gap between those two numbers is your resilience debt. And most organizations do not know how large it is until something breaks.

The article includes an interactive calculator where you can assess your own facility. A 2N design operated by a reactive organization delivers far less than its theoretical availability. Sometimes an N+1 facility with strong ops outperforms a poorly operated 2N site.
