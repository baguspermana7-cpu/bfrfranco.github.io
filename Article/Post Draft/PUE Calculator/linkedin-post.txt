The global average data center PUE is 1.58. That means 37% of total power never reaches the IT equipment -- it is consumed by cooling, UPS losses, transformers, and facility overhead.

The difference between PUE 1.8 and PUE 1.4 at a 5 MW facility is roughly $1.75 million per year in energy costs.

I built a PUE Calculator that models efficiency from first principles rather than lookup tables. Every input -- cooling COP, UPS topology, climate zone, containment strategy -- directly affects the calculation through engineering relationships.

What it covers:

- 6 cooling architectures: CRAC, CRAH, In-Row, RDHX, DLC, Immersion
- 6 climate zones from tropical humid to cold
- 4 UPS topologies with load factor modeling
- Containment strategy impact (10-25% improvement)
- Facility loads: lighting, security, fire suppression
- Pro mode: economizers, ASHRAE supply temp, transformer/PDU losses, growth projections

The tool is aligned with ASHRAE TC 9.9 and Green Grid standards. It runs entirely in the browser -- no data transmitted.

Use it to compare cooling architectures, justify efficiency upgrades, or model how climate zone selection affects long-term energy costs.
