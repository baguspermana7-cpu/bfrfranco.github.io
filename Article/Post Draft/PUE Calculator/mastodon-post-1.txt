Global average data center PUE is 1.58 -- meaning 37% of power never reaches the servers.

Built a free calculator that models PUE from first principles: cooling COP, UPS topology, containment, climate zone, and facility loads. Not lookup tables -- actual engineering relationships.

6 cooling types, 6 climate zones, 4 UPS topologies.
