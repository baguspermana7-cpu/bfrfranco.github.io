CRAC cooling has a COP of about 2.8. Immersion cooling reaches COP 25. That single variable can shift PUE from 1.8 to below 1.2.

The PUE Calculator lets you compare all six cooling architectures side by side and see exactly how each one affects total facility power consumption, wasted energy, and annual cost.
