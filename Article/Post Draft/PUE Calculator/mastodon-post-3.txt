The difference between PUE 1.8 and PUE 1.4 at a 5 MW facility is roughly $1.75M/year in energy costs.

The PUE Calculator models where that overhead comes from -- cooling, UPS losses, transformers, PDU efficiency, lighting, security -- and shows which improvements have the highest impact for your specific configuration.
