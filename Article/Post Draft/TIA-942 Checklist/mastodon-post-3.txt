What separates Tier 3 from Tier 4?

Tier 3: any component can be serviced without IT interruption. Tier 4: the facility sustains any single fault with zero impact -- 2N power, 2N cooling, fully independent paths.

The TIA-942 Checklist dynamically filters 56 items to show exactly what each tier demands, with weighted scoring and gap analysis.
