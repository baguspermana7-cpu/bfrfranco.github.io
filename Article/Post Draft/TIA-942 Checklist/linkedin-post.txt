Every data center claims a tier level. Far fewer can demonstrate compliance against TIA-942-B, the standard that actually defines those tiers.

Compliance assessment is typically a manual, document-heavy process. For teams that want to self-assess before a formal audit or track progress during a build-out, I built an interactive checklist.

The TIA-942 Compliance Checklist covers:

- 56 checklist items across 6 categories
- Site/Architecture, Electrical, Mechanical, Telecom, Fire Protection, Security
- Tier 1 through Tier 4 filtering
- Weighted scoring (Critical/Important/Standard) with category importance multipliers
- Real-time compliance score, risk index, and weakest category identification
- Each item mapped to specific TIA-942-B section references

The scoring is not a simple checkbox count. Electrical items carry 1.5x weight because electrical failures are the leading cause of data center downtime. Missing backup generators affects your score differently than missing visitor management signage.

Pro features include gap analysis with prioritized remediation, Monte Carlo risk simulation, multi-tier radar comparison, and remediation roadmap with cost and timeline estimates.

The tool runs entirely in your browser. No facility data is transmitted.

Whether you are preparing for a certification audit, validating a new build design, or tracking compliance during phased upgrades -- this gives you a structured starting point.
