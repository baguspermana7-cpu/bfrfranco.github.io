A single AI data center consumes the same electricity as 100,000 homes. The largest ones under construction? 2 million homes.

So why are citizens across Southeast Asia being told to save electricity while these facilities get connected to the grid without question?

I spent weeks digging into this. The numbers are uncomfortable.

Globally, data centers consumed 415 TWh of electricity in 2024. By 2030, the IEA projects that figure will hit 945 TWh. That is a 15% annual growth rate, four times faster than every other sector combined.

In the US, we already have a preview of what happens next. Consumers in the PJM grid region (covering 67 million people across 13 states) paid $7.7 billion for transmission upgrades driven largely by data center demand. Bloomberg found electricity costs 267% higher in areas near major data center clusters compared to five years ago. Monthly household bills are projected to jump $70 by 2028.

Southeast Asia is next. The region's data center capacity is set to grow from 1.68 GW to 7.59 GW by 2030. That is a 4.5x increase in six years. Malaysia alone has data center power applications exceeding 11,000 MW. Indonesia allocated IDR 83 trillion ($5.1 billion) in electricity subsidies in 2025, and the gap between actual generation cost (IDR 1,732/kWh) and what consumers pay (IDR 1,153/kWh) is already massive before you add hundreds of MW of new data center load.

When that load hits the grid, it requires new transmission lines, substation upgrades, and generation capacity additions. Those costs get rolled into the rate base and spread across all consumers. Ordinary families end up subsidizing infrastructure built to serve data centers.

The technology is not the problem. The policy framework is.

Some places are responding. Singapore imposed a moratorium on new data centers and now requires PUE below 1.25 and 50% green energy sourcing. Over 60 bills related to data center cost allocation were introduced across 22 US states in 2025. Malaysia's new tariff structure explicitly states that high-powered users like data centers will pay higher, cost-reflective tariffs.

I built an interactive calculator that lets you estimate the impact on your own electricity bill based on your country, usage, and projected data center growth. Give it a try.
