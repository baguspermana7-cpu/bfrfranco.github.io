# The $64 Billion Rebellion: Why Communities Worldwide Are Fighting Data Centers

On February 7, 2026, something unprecedented happened in Southeast Asia. Fifty residents of Gelang Patah, a district in Johor, Malaysia, gathered outside a construction site less than one kilometer from their homes. Their target: a 38-acre data center being built by Zdata Technologies, a Chinese-owned developer. Police watched as protesters held signs demanding answers about dust pollution, water scarcity, and the facility's impact on their daily lives.

The developer did not come out to meet them.

This was Malaysia's first-ever public protest against a data center. But it was not an isolated event. It was the latest eruption in a global rebellion that has already blocked or delayed $64 billion worth of projects in the United States alone.

For those of us who work inside data centers, maintaining generators, managing cooling systems, coordinating with grid operators, this backlash is not abstract. It is personal. The communities organizing against our industry have legitimate grievances. But the industry also provides genuine economic value that opponents rarely acknowledge.

This article examines both sides, with data.

## The Scale of Opposition

The numbers are striking. Between 2023 and mid-2025, community opposition in the US blocked $18 billion in projects outright and delayed $46 billion more by over two years. 142 activist groups organized across 24 states. Project cancellations quadrupled from 6 in 2024 to 25 in 2025.

The pattern is clear in the data. In Chandler, Arizona, the city council voted 7-0 to reject a $2.5 billion data center in December 2025 despite lobbying from former Senator Kyrsten Sinema. In Tucson, Amazon's 600 MW campus was rejected unanimously. In Louisa County, Virginia, AWS withdrew a 7.2 million square foot proposal after community mobilization under the banner "Don't Loudoun my Louisa." In Warrenton, Virginia, voters replaced their entire town council and voted 6-0 to eliminate all data center zoning. In New Orleans, the city council unanimously passed a one-year construction ban in January 2026.

## Follow the Money: The Electricity Bill Crisis

The single most politically explosive issue is electricity costs. When your neighbor's power bill rises while the data center next door negotiates below-market rates, the math becomes personal.

A joint study by Carnegie Mellon University and NC State University projected that data center and cryptocurrency mining electricity demand will grow 350% by 2030. The national average impact: an 8% increase in electricity bills by 2030. In Northern Virginia, the increase could exceed 25%. Baltimore residents have already seen $17 per month increases, with $70 per month projected by 2028. Dominion Energy territory faces a projected $255 per month residential bill by 2035.

The PJM Interconnection, the grid operator serving 65 million people across 13 states, held its December 2025 capacity auction. The results were devastating for ratepayers: $16.4 billion in total auction costs for 12-month capacity. Data centers accounted for 40% of that, approximately $6.5 billion. Across three consecutive auctions, the total reached $21.3 billion with 45% attributable to data centers. PJM's reserve margin fell to 14.8% against a 20% reliability target.

PJM's Independent Market Monitor took the extraordinary step of filing an emergency complaint with FERC, seeking to block grid operators from connecting new data center loads until supply reliability can be guaranteed.

## The Cross-Subsidy Problem

Harvard's Electricity Law Initiative published a landmark paper in March 2025 identifying three mechanisms through which data center costs are shifted to residential customers.

First, secret special contracts: utilities negotiate discounted bilateral rates with data center operators through opaque regulatory processes. When the rate is below the utility's cost to serve, other ratepayers absorb the difference. Second, transmission cost allocation: PJM approved $5 billion in new interstate transmission projects largely for data centers, with Maryland utilities paying approximately $500 million, passed to residential bills. Third, colocation arrangements: behind-the-meter colocation between data centers and power plants can increase wholesale prices for all other customers.

The Harvard study noted that residential electricity prices rose 25% from 2020-2024 while industrial prices fell 2%. In data center-heavy regions, wholesale costs surged 267% in five years.

Electricity bills are now an electoral force. In Virginia's 2025 governor's race, Democrat Abigail Spanberger won by 14 points on a platform that data centers must "pay their fair share." In February 2026, Senators Hawley and Blumenthal introduced the bipartisan GRID Act, the first federal bill to prevent data center power usage from raising consumer bills.

## Water Wars: From Oregon to Johor

Water is the most potent community rallying point. Cited in over 40% of contested projects, water scarcity creates visceral, non-negotiable opposition.

## The Johor Water Crisis

The Johor protest did not emerge from nowhere. Malaysia's southern state hosts 47 data centers built or under construction. Data center applications across three Malaysian states have requested 808 million litres of water per day, but the available supply capacity is only 142 million litres per day. That is a 5.7x oversubscription.

In November 2025, Johor stopped approving Tier 1 and Tier 2 data centers entirely, citing water overuse. Investors were told to halt water-cooled expansion projects until mid-2027. Some operators, unable to wait, reportedly began purchasing water via tanker trucks, a crisis indicator in any infrastructure sector.

In The Dalles, Oregon, Google's data center complex consumed 355 million gallons of water in 2021, 29% of the city's total supply and triple its consumption from a few years earlier. When The Oregonian newspaper sought water usage data, Google paid $100,000 to fund the city's lawsuit against the newspaper to suppress the figures. The suit was ultimately dropped.

In Tucson, Arizona, Amazon's Project Blue would have consumed approximately 2,000 acre-feet of water annually, making it Tucson Water's single largest customer. The city council unanimously rejected it.

The technical reality: a large data center can consume up to 5 million gallons per day, equivalent to a town of 10,000 to 50,000 people. A single megawatt of traditional cooling requires approximately 26 million litres per year. Over 40% of planned and existing US data centers are located in areas classified as high or extremely high water scarcity.

## The Air We Breathe: Diesel and Health

Behind every "100% renewable energy" claim from a hyperscaler sits a fleet of diesel backup generators. As someone who has operated and maintained these generators for over a decade, I can tell you: the gap between marketing and operational reality is significant.

Northern Virginia alone has approximately 9,000 permitted Tier II diesel generators with combined capacity exceeding 11 GW, more than Dominion Energy's entire natural gas fleet.

The emissions trajectory from 2015 to 2023: CO emissions grew 196%. NOx emissions grew 111%. PM2.5 grew 139%.

Virginia's JLARC found that in a worst-case scenario, these generators could release 9,000 tons of nitrogen oxides, equal to half of all annual NOx emissions in Northern Virginia from all sources combined. VCU researchers confirmed that Northern Virginia data center air pollution now rivals power plant emissions.

UC Riverside and Caltech researchers projected 1,300 premature deaths per year by 2030 from data center-related air pollution, with total annual public health costs of approximately $20 billion. In Northern Virginia specifically, diesel generator operations are associated with an estimated 14,000 asthma symptom cases per year.

An important caveat: the UC Riverside/Caltech study is a modeling exercise from an arXiv preprint, not a field epidemiological study. No peer-reviewed, field-based study directly measuring health outcomes in communities adjacent to data center clusters currently exists. This is a critical research gap.

In Great Oaks subdivision near Manassas, Virginia, residents live 400 feet from Amazon data centers. Post-mitigation noise levels measured 62 dB, well above proposed local limits of 52 dB daytime and 47 dB nighttime. The WHO recommends nighttime noise below 40 dB for healthy sleep.

## The Industry's Defense

The community arguments are real. But so is the counter-case. As an industry insider who sees both sides, I must present the economic evidence fairly.

Harvard economist Jason Furman provided the industry's single most powerful statistic: without data centers, GDP growth was 0.1% in the first half of 2025. Information processing equipment and software represent 4% of GDP but were responsible for 92% of GDP growth in H1 2025.

Loudoun County, Virginia remains the industry's strongest fiscal argument. Data centers generate over $900 million in annual tax revenue. The revenue ratio is $26 for every $1 of services provided to data centers. Data centers use less than 3% of county land area. That $26-to-$1 ratio is 20-25x more fiscally efficient than residential development.

Data center operators accounted for 43% of all clean energy PPAs signed in 2024. Amazon has over 20 GW globally. Microsoft contracted 10.5 GW of new capacity for 2026-2030. Meta has 15+ GW of wind and solar and restored 1.59 billion gallons of water in 2024.

But the fiscal story has a dark side. Virginia's data center tax exemptions cost the state $1.6 billion in FY2025, a 118% increase over FY2023. States that compute ROI find they lose 52-70 cents for every dollar spent on data center tax exemptions. The most extreme case: Genesee County, New York granted $801 million in tax breaks to Stream Data Centers for 125 jobs, that is $6.4 million per permanent job.

At the local level, data centers are often significant net fiscal contributors. At the state level, tax exemptions produce negative returns. The net impact depends entirely on whether jurisdictions negotiate effectively or simply compete by offering the largest subsidies.

## The Government Response: A Global Moratorium Wave

Governments are no longer rolling out unconditional welcome mats.

Singapore imposed a moratorium from 2019 to 2022, then reopened with competitive allocation requiring PUE of 1.25 or less and 50% green energy. Ireland froze new connections from 2021 to 2025 with an 80% on-site renewable requirement. The Netherlands banned hyperscale data centers in Amsterdam until 2030. Johor, Malaysia banned Tier 1 and 2 data centers in November 2025 until mid-2027. New York proposed a 3-year moratorium for facilities over 20 MW. New Orleans enacted a unanimous 1-year ban in January 2026. Georgia saw moratoriums across 12 counties.

In total, six US states have introduced data center moratorium bills. Local moratoriums are active in at least 14 states. And 230+ environmental organizations signed a letter calling for a full nationwide moratorium in December 2025.

## The Path Forward: Coexistence Models

Neither blanket opposition nor uncritical acceptance serves anyone's interests. The evidence points toward specific, actionable frameworks.

On January 13, 2026, Microsoft announced the most comprehensive corporate response to community opposition to date: rejecting all municipal tax breaks and paying full local property taxes, ensuring data center electricity costs are not passed to residential customers, achieving 40% water efficiency improvement by 2030 and replenishing more water than consumed, partnering with Building Trades Unions for apprenticeships and local hiring, and publishing public dashboards with real-time energy, water, and economic impact metrics.

Whether Amazon, Google, and Meta match these commitments is the critical question for 2026.

In Stockholm, data centers heat 30,000 apartments through district heating integration. In Hamina, Finland, Google provides 80% of local district heating demand. Microsoft's facility under construction in Espoo will create the world's largest waste heat recovery scheme, heating Finland's second-largest city.

Drawing from all successful models globally, the evidence converges on seven principles for data center-community harmony: early transparent engagement, binding Community Benefit Agreements with measurable commitments, electricity rate protection where operators pay the full cost of power and grid upgrades, waste heat recovery or equivalent community energy contribution, net positive water that replenishes more than consumed, workforce development pipelines for both construction and operations, and competitive regulatory allocation following the Singapore model that forces operators to compete on community value.

## A Closing Perspective

I have built my career inside data centers. I understand their value to the economy and to society. But I also understand what it feels like to live near one.

The $64 billion rebellion is not going away. Communities are organized, informed, and politically effective. The industry can either adapt by embracing transparency, fair cost allocation, and genuine community partnership, or it can continue to lose projects worth billions.

The data is clear on what works. Microsoft's January 2026 commitments, Singapore's competitive allocation model, the Nordic waste heat integration, these are not theoretical frameworks. They are proven models.

The question is not whether communities and data centers can coexist. They can. The question is whether the industry is willing to pay the true cost of doing so.
