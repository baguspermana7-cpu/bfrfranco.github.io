$64 billion in data center projects blocked or delayed across 24 US states. 142 activist groups organized. And on February 7, 2026, Malaysia saw its first-ever data center protest.

I work in this industry. I have operated and maintained diesel backup generators for over 12 years. So when communities push back, I do not see it as abstract opposition. I see people asking questions I have asked myself.

Here is what the data actually shows:

Carnegie Mellon projects that data center electricity demand will grow 350% by 2030. Northern Virginia residents could see 25% bill increases. Baltimore already saw $17/month spikes. In the PJM capacity auction, data centers drove 40% of a $16.4 billion cost, and the grid operator filed an emergency complaint with FERC seeking to block new DC connections until supply reliability can be guaranteed.

In Johor, Malaysia, 47 data centers have requested 808 million litres of water per day. Available supply? 142 million. That is a 5.7x oversubscription. The state stopped approving Tier 1 and Tier 2 DCs entirely.

Northern Virginia has approximately 9,000 diesel generators with 11 GW of combined capacity. Diesel emissions there grew 196% (CO), 111% (NOx), and 139% (PM2.5) between 2015 and 2023.

But the counter-argument is real too. Without data center investment, US GDP growth would have been 0.1% in H1 2025. Loudoun County earns $26 in tax revenue for every $1 of services DCs require. Data center operators signed 43% of all clean energy PPAs in 2024.

The problem is not data centers themselves. It is how they are built and governed.

Microsoft announced in January 2026 that it will reject all municipal tax breaks, cover full electricity costs, improve water efficiency by 40%, and publish real-time impact dashboards. If every operator matched those commitments, half the community opposition would dissolve overnight.

The industry needs to stop treating community engagement as a PR exercise and start treating it as an engineering requirement.
