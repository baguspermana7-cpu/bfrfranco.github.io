CAPEX gets the boardroom presentations. OPEX is what actually determines whether a data center makes money.

Energy can consume 40-60% of annual operating costs. Staffing models -- in-house, hybrid, or outsourced -- can swing the budget by millions. And geography changes everything: electricity rates range from $0.03/kWh to $0.25/kWh depending on market.

Most teams still estimate OPEX with spreadsheets built on assumptions. I built a calculator to replace that guesswork with structured, country-specific benchmarks.

The Data Center OPEX Calculator covers:

- 30+ countries with localized energy rates and labor costs
- Three staffing models (in-house, hybrid, outsourced) with adjustable ratios
- Climate-adjusted cooling costs based on geographic zone
- Shift rotation modeling (12-hour and 8-hour schedules)
- Full cost breakdown: energy, staffing, maintenance, insurance, compliance, SGA
- Indonesia baseline with UMK rates and Ahli K3 Listrik requirements

It is free, runs entirely in the browser, and gives you a defensible first-pass estimate in under two minutes.

It will not replace a detailed financial model. But it will show you where the real cost drivers hide before they show up in your P&L.
