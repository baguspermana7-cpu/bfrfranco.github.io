58% of global data centers sit in water-stressed regions. And we keep building more there.

I spent the last few months digging into what this actually means for Southeast Asia, where $30 billion in data center investment is expected by 2030. Most of that money is heading straight into Jakarta and Bekasi, areas with water stress indices hitting 85%.

Here is the part that keeps me up at night: a single 100MW AI data center can consume 1 to 2 billion liters of water per year. A 10MW facility with a WUE of 1.5 already drinks through 131 million liters annually. That is 52 Olympic swimming pools worth of water, pulled from communities that are already struggling.

The Bekasi corridor alone has over 1,050MW of planned capacity across multiple campuses, including Digital Edge's US$4.5 billion, 500MW project. Meanwhile, the Bekasi River Basin saw a 43% increase in built-up areas between 1990 and 2018. Floods hit 100,000+ residents in recent years. And during dry seasons, groundwater extraction creates the opposite problem: severe water scarcity.

But here is where the conversation needs to shift. Southeast Asia is not uniformly water-stressed. I mapped 11 data center hubs across the region, and the variation is significant:

- Jakarta/Bekasi: 85% water stress (Extremely High)
- Singapore: 72% (High)
- Johor Bahru: 18% (Low)
- Da Nang: 18% (Low)
- Hanoi: 22% (Medium)

Johor Bahru sits 1km from Singapore via causeway, with land costs 60-70% lower. Da Nang has submarine cable access and infrastructure utilization under 40%. Hanoi gives you access to a 97 million population market with a growing tech workforce.

The operators who figure out regional diversification, pairing high-demand hubs with low-stress emerging markets, will have a real competitive edge. Direct liquid cooling, recycled water systems, and smarter site selection are not just sustainability plays. They are risk management.

I wrote the full analysis with an interactive water consumption calculator that lets you model your own facility across 8 SEA regions.
