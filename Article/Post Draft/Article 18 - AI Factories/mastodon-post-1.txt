Traditional data center: 10 kW per rack.
NVIDIA GB300 NVL72: 132 kW per rack.

That is a 13x density increase. Air cooling hits a physics wall at 30 kW. Every AI rack above that needs liquid cooling. No exceptions.

The liquid cooling market: $2.84B in 2025, projected $21-44B by 2032. 33% CAGR driven by thermodynamics, not hype.

Direct-to-Chip cooling captures 42.85% of revenue because it works for retrofits. Immersion cooling promises more but faces PFAS regulatory risk.

Facilities that cannot adapt become stranded assets.
