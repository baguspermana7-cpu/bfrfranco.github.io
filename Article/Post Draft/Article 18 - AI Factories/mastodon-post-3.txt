The network war nobody is talking about:

Ultra Ethernet vs InfiniBand.

UEC 1.0 launched June 2025. Open Ethernet now approaches InfiniBand performance.

The split: Ultra Ethernet wins inference scale-out (cost, open ecosystem). InfiniBand holds frontier training (latency under 1 microsecond, proven at 100K+ GPUs).

Most large operators are building for both. The cost-per-token metric now matters more than peak FLOPS.

Meanwhile, stranded asset risk is real. AI hardware refresh cycles under 5 years. Facilities that cannot support 3-ton racks or liquid cooling pipes face obsolescence.
