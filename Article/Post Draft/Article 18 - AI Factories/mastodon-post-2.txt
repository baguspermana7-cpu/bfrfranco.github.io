The hyperscaler CAPEX race in 2026:

Amazon: $200B
Alphabet: $185B
Microsoft: $120B+
Meta: $100B+

Combined: $600B+. Roughly 75% tied to AI infrastructure.

Meta is reinvesting 57% of revenue into infrastructure. No precedent in tech history.

Jensen Huang: "This is the largest industrial buildout in human history."

They are not building data centers. They are building AI Factories.
