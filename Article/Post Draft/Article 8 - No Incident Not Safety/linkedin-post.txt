Your data center has been incident-free for 18 months. Your dashboard is green. Management is celebrating. And you might be closer to a catastrophic failure than you were a year ago.

That sounds counterintuitive, but safety science backs it up.

Uptime Institute's 2023 Annual Outage Analysis found that 70% of data center outages were caused by factors that had been present and potentially detectable for weeks or months before the incident. The 2024 report confirmed human error, often showing up as procedural drift during "stable" periods, remained the top root cause category.

The problem is not bad people. The problem is what Jens Rasmussen called drift-to-failure. Under normal production pressure, organizations gradually migrate toward their safety boundaries. Each step is locally rational. A 4-hour maintenance window becomes 3 hours, then 2.5. Nobody makes a conscious decision to be unsafe. But the cumulative effect is progressive erosion of safety margins while the lagging indicator dashboard stays perfectly green.

Diane Vaughan documented the same thing in her Challenger disaster study. She called it normalization of deviance. Deviations that produce no consequence get rationalized, then become precedent, then become invisible. New team members learn the deviated procedure as standard. The original design intent quietly disappears.

I have seen this pattern firsthand. Near-miss reports decline from 5 per month to zero, and management interprets the silence as improvement. Audit findings pile up from 3 to 14 while everyone points at the clean incident record. Training hours get cut because "the numbers look great."

The HSE Research Report 367 found that organizations with the strongest incident-free cultures often had the weakest near-miss reporting rates. The correlation was causal. The pursuit of zero created silence where there should have been signal.

What actually works is measuring leading indicators: near-miss reporting rates, weak signal detection, open audit finding counts, safety training hours, management safety walks, hazard action close-out rates. These move before an incident occurs. A declining Safety Health Index during an incident-free period is the exact pattern that precedes catastrophic failure.

A green dashboard does not mean the system is safe. It means the system has not yet failed. Those are fundamentally different propositions.
