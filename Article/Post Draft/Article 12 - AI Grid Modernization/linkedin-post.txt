Everyone keeps telling you AI data centers are destroying the grid.

I wrote the same story last month. And then I looked at the numbers from the other side.

Amazon has contracted 34 GW of renewable energy capacity. That is larger than Malaysia's entire electricity generation capacity. Microsoft committed 23.2 GW, including a $10+ billion deal with Brookfield Renewable. Meta just announced 6+ GW of nuclear partnerships in January 2026 alone.

These are not press releases. These are contracted Power Purchase Agreements that provide the financial certainty developers need to actually build wind farms, solar arrays, and even restart nuclear plants. In 2024, corporate PPAs hit 50+ GW globally. Tech companies represented roughly 40% of that volume.

Here is what rarely gets discussed: data centers run at 85-95% load factor. Residential demand sits at 30-40%. From a grid operator's perspective, that steady, predictable consumption is the ideal customer. The E3 study for Northern Virginia found data centers generate approximately $33,500 per MW in annual grid surplus value. They pay MORE into the system than the cost of serving them.

PJM is investing $5.9-6.7 billion in transmission upgrades. Yes, data center demand triggered some of it. But those upgrades serve every customer on the grid, enable more renewable integration, and make the infrastructure more resilient for everyone.

And efficiency keeps improving. Average PUE dropped from above 2.5 in 2010 to 1.56 in 2024. Google runs at 1.10. Lawrence Berkeley National Lab found that migrating from on-premise servers to hyperscale cloud cuts energy use by 72-93% for the same workload.

None of this makes data centers angels. They are profit-driven companies making calculated investments. But framing it as "data centers vs. citizens" misses the $57B+ in renewable investment, the grid modernization nobody else would fund, and the economic value that extends far beyond electricity bills.

The real conversation should be about transparent cost allocation, mandatory renewable matching for new facilities, and ensuring host communities share the benefits.

I wrote the full counter-analysis with data tables, an interactive economic value calculator, and 12 sourced references.
