How much of your country's carbon budget does your data center consume?

The Paris Agreement sets national reduction targets (NDCs). The US pledges 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030. The EU targets 55% below 1990 levels. Each country has a finite carbon budget, and data centers are claiming a growing share of it.

With DC sector electricity consumption reaching 18% in Ireland, 7% in Singapore, and 25% of the local grid in Northern Virginia -- the question is no longer if this gets regulated, but when.

Built a National DC Carbon Budget Allocator that calculates your facility's fair share based on country NDC targets, DC sector growth rates, workload mix (AI training, inference, cloud, enterprise), and your renewable procurement timeline.

If your per-MW emissions exceed the budget, you are consuming more than your fair share.
