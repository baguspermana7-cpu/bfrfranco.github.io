A 1 MW data center uses roughly 1,000 tons of concrete and 200 tons of structural steel before it serves a single workload.

That is anywhere from 150,000 to 250,000 kgCO2e just from concrete -- depending on whether you spec C30 standard or C40 high-strength. Choose EAF recycled steel at 500 kgCO2e/ton instead of virgin BOF at 2,200 and you cut structural steel emissions by 77%.

Life-cycle assessment following EN 15978 (modules A1 through D) captures what operational metrics miss: materials extraction, transport, construction activity, equipment manufacturing, and end-of-life recycling credits.

Built a calculator that models the full cradle-to-grave carbon picture for data centers, including seismic zone multipliers, battery chemistry comparisons, and Module D recycling offsets:
