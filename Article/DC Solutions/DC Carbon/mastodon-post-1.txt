Your data center has three carbon scopes, not one.

Scope 1: Diesel generators burning 0.3 L/kW/hr during tests. R-410A refrigerant (GWP 2,088) leaking at 5%/yr.

Scope 2: Grid electricity -- ranging from 0.04 kgCO2/kWh in Sweden to 0.90 in South Africa. This is where renewables make the biggest dent.

Scope 3: Embodied carbon in servers, construction materials, and supply chain. An H100 GPU server carries 4,000 kgCO2e before it ever powers on.
