The hidden carbon problem in data centers is not just about electricity.

Most carbon assessments stop at Scope 2 -- purchased electricity. But that only tells part of the story.

What about the 1,850 kgCO2e per ton of structural steel in your facility? The 4,000 kgCO2e embodied in each NVIDIA H100 GPU server? The 2,088 GWP of R-410A refrigerant leaking at 5% annually from your CRAC units?

These are the emissions nobody talks about -- and they can represent 15-30% of your total cradle-to-grave carbon footprint.

I built a free interactive calculator that addresses all three dimensions of data center carbon:

1. Operational Emissions (GHG Protocol Scope 1/2/3)
-- Grid emission factors for 33 countries (from 0.04 kgCO2/kWh in Sweden to 0.90 in South Africa)
-- Diesel generator combustion and refrigerant fugitive emissions
-- Renewable energy offsets via PPA, REC, and on-site solar

2. Life-Cycle Assessment (EN 15978 Modules A1 through D)
-- Embodied carbon from concrete, steel, copper, and aluminum
-- IT equipment manufacturing emissions across server refresh cycles
-- Transport and construction phase modeling
-- End-of-life recycling credits under Module D

3. National Carbon Budget Allocation (Paris Agreement Aligned)
-- NDC reduction targets for all 33 countries
-- Data center sector share of national carbon budgets
-- Workload-based allocation across AI training, inference, cloud, and enterprise

The Pro tier adds Monte Carlo risk simulation with 10,000 iterations, sensitivity tornado analysis identifying which variables drive the most uncertainty, reduction scenario modeling, financial compliance assessment (EU ETS, CBAM, SEC/CSRD), and PDF export.

Every calculation runs client-side in your browser. No data is transmitted to any server.

Whether you are planning a new build, optimizing an existing facility, or preparing for regulatory disclosure under the EU Energy Efficiency Directive or SEC Climate Rule -- this tool gives you the numbers you need.
