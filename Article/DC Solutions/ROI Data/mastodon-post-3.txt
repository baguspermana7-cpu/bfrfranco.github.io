A single NPV number tells you nothing about how likely that outcome actually is.

The Data Center ROI Calculator runs 10,000 Monte Carlo iterations varying revenue, occupancy, and OPEX to produce a probability distribution of returns. It shows P5, P50, P95 outcomes and the probability of positive NPV.

The sensitivity tornado tells you which variable moves the needle most -- revenue per kW, occupancy velocity, electricity cost, PUE, CAPEX, or interest rate.
