Most data center investment models are built in spreadsheets that hide their assumptions. Revenue grows linearly. Occupancy fills instantly. Debt service is a footnote. Risk is a single discount rate.

That is not how a $100M+ infrastructure investment actually works.

I built a Data Center ROI Calculator that models the full financial structure of a data center investment -- from initial CAPEX deployment through terminal value realization.

What it calculates:

- Net Present Value (NPV) with configurable discount rates
- Internal Rate of Return (IRR) via Newton-Raphson iteration (200 cycles for convergence)
- Simple payback and discounted payback period
- Profitability Index for capital efficiency ranking
- Year-by-year cashflow projections with cumulative tracking

What you can configure across 6 input sections:

Investment: Total CAPEX ($M), IT capacity (MW), project timeline, construction period
Revenue: Per-kW pricing, annual escalation, ancillary revenue percentage
OPEX: Electricity rate, PUE, staffing, maintenance, insurance, cost escalation
Occupancy: 4 ramp profiles (Conservative, Moderate, Aggressive, Custom) with year-by-year fill rates
Financing: Debt/equity split (0-80%), interest rate, loan term, loan amortization
Tax and Exit: Tax rate, depreciation method (straight-line, MACRS, bonus), terminal value via cap rate or book value

The occupancy ramp is where most models get it wrong. A 10 MW colocation facility does not go from zero to 85% occupancy overnight. The calculator models realistic fill curves -- conservative ramps take 7+ years to reach stabilized occupancy, and those early years of negative or thin cash flow are exactly what kills levered returns.

Premium features include Monte Carlo simulation (10,000 iterations varying revenue, occupancy, and OPEX), sensitivity tornado analysis showing which variables have the largest NPV impact, scenario modeling (Base, Bull, Bear, AI Boom, Rate Shock), and PDF export with the full cashflow table for stakeholder presentations.

The tool runs entirely in the browser. No data is transmitted to any server.

Whether you are building a business case for a new facility, stress-testing an acquisition target, or benchmarking levered vs unlevered returns, this gives you a structured analytical framework in under 2 minutes.
