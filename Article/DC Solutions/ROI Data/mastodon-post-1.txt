A data center with a 15% IRR and a 7-year payback looks good on paper. But that IRR was calculated with instant occupancy and no debt service.

Built a free ROI Calculator that computes NPV, IRR (Newton-Raphson, 200 iterations), discounted payback, and Profitability Index -- with realistic occupancy ramps and full debt/equity structure.

6 input sections covering CAPEX, revenue, OPEX, occupancy, financing, and tax.
