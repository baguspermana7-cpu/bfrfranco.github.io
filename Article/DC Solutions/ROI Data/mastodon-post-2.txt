The occupancy ramp is where most data center financial models fall apart.

A conservative 10 MW colocation build might take 7+ years to reach 90% occupancy. Those early years of thin or negative cash flow destroy levered returns that looked great at stabilized assumptions.

This ROI Calculator models 4 ramp profiles (Conservative, Moderate, Aggressive, Custom) with year-by-year cashflow projections, debt service, and cumulative tracking.
