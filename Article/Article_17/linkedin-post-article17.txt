Everyone says Southeast Asia's data center boom is a bubble.

I wrote a 12,000-word article arguing the opposite.

Here's the contrarian case:

1. JEVONS PARADOX
DeepSeek trained AI for $5.6M instead of $100M.
Bears said: "See? AI needs less infrastructure."
Reality: Meta RAISED spending to $65B the next week.
Cheaper AI = more users = MORE demand, not less.

2. THE $1 TRILLION NOBODY COUNTED
SEA's digital economy: $300B today. $1T by 2030.
Indonesia alone: 280M people, $360B digital economy by 2030.
Malaysia: 19% YoY digital growth — fastest in SEA.
This demand doesn't show up in pipeline analyses.

3. SOVEREIGN AI: 6 NATIONS, 1,500+ MW
Indonesia: $140B GDP target from AI by 2030.
Malaysia: RM 2B sovereign AI cloud, 3,000 GPUs.
Every nation in SEA now LEGALLY REQUIRES local data processing.
That's non-discretionary demand backed by law.

4. THE INFERENCE ECONOMY
AI inference = 75% of all AI compute by 2030.
Growing at 35% CAGR. Projected to reach 90 GW.
And it MUST be local. You can't run real-time inference from another country.

5. HISTORY SAYS THE BEARS ARE WRONG
Fiber optics 2001: "Bubble!" → became the internet backbone.
Northern Virginia 2012: "Overbuilt!" → now the most valuable DC market on Earth.
Every great infrastructure build-out looked excessive at the time.

6. SMART MONEY IS DOUBLING DOWN
Blackstone: $70B+ in DC infrastructure.
AirTrunk acquired for $16.1B.
GIC, Brookfield, KKR — all accelerating.
If this were a bubble, the smartest investors on Earth wouldn't be racing in.

The pipeline might look excessive.
Some projects will struggle.
But the builders who survive will own the infrastructure of a $1T economy.

This is the companion piece to my bubble analysis (Article 16).
Read both. Then decide which side of history you want to be on.
