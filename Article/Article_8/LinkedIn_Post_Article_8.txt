Why "No Incident" Is Not Evidence of Safety

"We've had zero incidents this quarter."

In data center operations, this sentence should make you uncomfortable.

Here's why:

The Absence of Evidence Fallacy:

"No incidents" tells us what DIDN'T happen.
It tells us nothing about:
- Near-misses that were caught
- Weak signals accumulating
- Latent conditions developing
- Drift from safe operating boundaries

The Heinrich Pyramid Problem:

For every major incident, there are:
- 10 minor incidents
- 30 near-misses
- 300+ unsafe conditions

If you're only measuring the tip of the pyramid, you're missing 99% of the signal.

What We Should Measure Instead:

Leading Indicators:
- Near-miss reporting rate (healthy = 10:1 vs incidents)
- Maintenance compliance % and trends
- Alarm acknowledgment times
- Training completion rates
- Procedure deviation reports

Process Metrics:
- Time to detect anomalies
- Decision-making latency during events
- Communication effectiveness scores
- Post-maintenance failure rates

Safety Science Insight:

Systems don't suddenly fail. They drift.

Small compromises accumulate:
- "Just this once" becomes standard
- Workarounds become procedures
- Signals get normalized

The dashboard stays green while the system moves toward failure.

My Approach:

After managing 12+ years of critical infrastructure:
- Track weak signals, not just incidents
- Celebrate near-miss reports (they're gifts)
- Question long periods of "nothing happening"
- Build systems that make drift visible
