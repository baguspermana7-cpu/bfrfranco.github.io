AI Data Centers vs Citizen Electricity Bills: Who Really Pays?

"Why are citizens asked to save electricity while AI data centers consume megawatts?"

This question is sparking debates across Southeast Asia. And the frustration is understandable when you see the numbers:

The Scale:
- A single AI data center = 100,000 households electricity consumption
- Largest facilities under construction = 2 MILLION homes equivalent
- Global DC consumption: 415 TWh (2024) projected to 945 TWh by 2030

The Southeast Asia Reality:
- SEA DC capacity: 1.68 GW growing to 7.59 GW by 2030 (4.5x increase)
- Singapore: ~7% of national grid goes to data centers
- Malaysia TNB expects 5,000 MW DC demand by 2035

The US Warning (Preview for SEA):
- PJM region consumers paid $7.7 BILLION for transmission upgrades
- Household bills projected +$70/month by 2028
- 267% higher electricity costs near DC clusters

I built an interactive Impact Calculator that estimates:
- DC annual consumption vs household equivalents
- Projected tariff increases by country/year
- Your personal monthly/annual cost impact
- National grid load analysis

The data is clear. The question is: what policy frameworks will SEA adopt?

60+ US bills introduced across 22 states. Malaysia implementing cost-reflective tariffs. Singapore using supply limits.

The conversation has begun.
