I asked 3 vendors to quote a 10 MW data center. Same spec, same city, same tier.

The answers: $95M, $142M, and $187M.

So I built a free CAPEX calculator. Set your IT load, cooling type, redundancy, seismic zone — see exactly how each variable moves the total.

Not a replacement for engineering estimates. But the fastest way to build a defensible cost range before your next board meeting.
