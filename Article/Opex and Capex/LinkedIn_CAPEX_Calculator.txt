I asked 3 vendors to quote a 10 MW data center.

The answers: $95M, $142M, and $187M.

Same spec. Same city. Same tier.

That's not a rounding error. That's someone's career on the line.

Here's the uncomfortable truth about data center CAPEX:

Most people build their cost model AFTER they've already committed to a design.

They pick the cooling system first, then discover it added $18M.
They spec 2N redundancy "just in case," then wonder where $30M went.
They forget seismic bracing, fire suppression upgrades, or generator fuel storage — and the change orders start piling up.

So I built something.

A free, interactive CAPEX calculator that lets you:
→ Set your IT load (100 kW to 100 MW)
→ Choose between 4 cooling architectures
→ Toggle redundancy from N to 2N+1
→ Adjust for seismic zones, building types, location factors
→ See EXACTLY how each variable moves the total — in real time

Is it a replacement for a full engineering estimate? No.
Is it the fastest way to build a defensible cost range before your next board meeting? Absolutely.

I built this from years of seeing how small assumptions create massive budget gaps.

Try it free — link in comments.

If your project has unique constraints (liquid cooling for AI/HPC, tropical climate design, emerging market builds), that's where general tools stop and real engineering starts.
