I asked 3 vendors to quote a 10 MW data center.

The answers: $95M, $142M, and $187M.

Same spec. Same city. Same tier.

That's not a rounding error. That's someone's career on the line.

Here's the uncomfortable truth about data center CAPEX:

Most people build their cost model AFTER they've already committed to a design.

They pick the cooling system first, then discover it added $18M.
They spec 2N redundancy "just in case," then wonder where $30M went.
They forget seismic bracing, fire suppression upgrades, or generator fuel storage — and the change orders start piling up.

So I built something.

A free, interactive CAPEX calculator that lets you:
→ Set your IT load (100 kW to 100 MW)
→ Choose between 4 cooling architectures
→ Toggle redundancy from N to 2N+1
→ Adjust for seismic zones, building types, location factors
→ See EXACTLY how each variable moves the total — in real time

Is it a replacement for a full engineering estimate? No.
Is it the fastest way to build a defensible cost range before your next board meeting? Absolutely.

I built this from years of seeing how small assumptions create massive budget gaps.

If your project has unique constraints (liquid cooling for AI/HPC, tropical climate design, emerging market builds), that's where general tools stop and real engineering starts.

LINKEDIN COMMENT CAPTIONS — CAPEX Calculator PDF Report (Pages 1-5)
Each comment accompanies a screenshot of the corresponding PDF page.

--- COMMENT 1 (Page 1: Report Header + Configuration + Cost Breakdown) ---

Page 1 of 5 — Configuration & Cost Breakdown

This is what a defensible CAPEX estimate looks like before you even call a contractor.

Every parameter — location, redundancy, cooling type, rack density, building type — feeds into the model. The cost breakdown shows exactly where your dollars go, component by component.

No guesswork. No "we'll figure it out during DD."

--- COMMENT 2 (Page 2: Premium Infrastructure Summary — Equipment Specs) ---

Page 2 of 5 — Equipment Specifications

The Pro report maps your configuration to real-world equipment: UPS brands and models, cooling systems, generators, fire suppression agents — with capacity ranges and compliance notes.

Because "we need a 2 MW UPS" is not a spec. Knowing that a Vertiv Trinergy or Schneider Galaxy VX fits your topology — that's a spec.

This is the level of detail your EPC contractor should be bringing to the table on day one.


--- COMMENT 3 (Page 3: Construction Timeline / Gantt) ---

Page 3 of 5 — Construction Timeline

Design → Procurement → Civil → MEP → Commissioning.

The model estimates your project timeline based on IT load, redundancy level, building type, and regional factors. It won't replace your project manager, but it will give you a realistic baseline before you commit to a delivery schedule.

Most budget overruns start here — unrealistic timelines that compress procurement and commissioning into impossible windows.


--- COMMENT 4 (Page 4: Sustainability & Environmental Metrics) ---

Page 4 of 5 — Sustainability Metrics

Annual MWh consumption. CO2 emissions. Water usage. Refrigerant GWP impact.

If your CAPEX model doesn't include sustainability, you're not building for 2026. Regulators, investors, and tenants are all asking the same question: what's the environmental footprint of this facility?

This page answers it — automatically, based on your design choices.


--- COMMENT 5 (Page 5: Narrative Conclusion) ---

Page 5 of 5 — Executive Narrative

The final page generates a plain-English summary of your entire design: what you specified, what it costs, why those numbers make sense, and what to watch out for.

This is the page you paste into your board memo or investment committee deck.

No jargon. No spreadsheet anxiety. Just a clear story backed by engineering logic.
