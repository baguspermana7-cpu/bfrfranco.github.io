Everyone obsesses over CAPEX.

Nobody talks about the cost that actually bankrupts data centers.

OPEX.

Here's what keeps CFOs up at night:

Your $120M facility is built. Ribbon cut. Photos taken.
Then reality hits:

→ Electricity bill: $400K/month (and climbing)
→ Staffing: varies 5x depending on the country
→ Maintenance: "we'll figure it out later" turns into $2M/year surprises
→ Climate penalty: your PUE in Jakarta is NOT the same as in Stockholm

And yet, most OPEX projections I've seen are a single line in a spreadsheet:
"Operating costs — $X per kW per month."

That's not a model. That's a prayer.

So I built an OPEX calculator that actually breaks it down:

→ 30+ countries with real labor rates and energy tariffs
→ Climate zone adjustments (tropical, arid, temperate, cold)
→ 3 staffing models: in-house, hybrid, outsourced — see the tradeoff instantly
→ Generator fuel burn, maintenance cycles, insurance, compliance
→ Full annual breakdown with visual cost distribution

The result? In under 2 minutes, you see WHERE your money actually goes.

Not a single number. A full picture.

Is every data center the same? Of course not.
But knowing that energy is 52% of your OPEX in Southeast Asia vs 38% in Nordics — that changes your entire site selection strategy.

Building in a market with unique tariff structures, government incentives, or non-standard staffing requirements? That's where the real conversation starts.
