Everyone in SEA is building data centers.

Nobody is asking who's going to fill them.

I spent weeks digging into the numbers. Here's what I found:

$37 billion committed.
6,068 MW of new capacity in the pipeline.
135 new facilities joining 290 existing ones.

And then there's Johor.

5.8 GW of planned capacity.
For a state of 3.8 million people.
That's enough power for 4.6 million homes.

Current vacancy? 1.1%.
Pipeline-to-operational ratio? 12x.

Let that sink in.

Meanwhile:
- Hyperscalers are spending 45-57% of revenue on capex ($602B in 2026)
- But they're also quietly building their OWN facilities in Malaysia and Singapore
- AWS's "$6B Malaysia investment" is spread over 15 YEARS -- that's $400M/year
- DeepSeek trained a competitive AI model for $5.6M instead of $100M

And what about legacy DCs?

The ones designed for 5 kW/rack watching the world move to 50-100 kW/rack.
They can't attract hyperscaler tenants.
Their enterprise customers are migrating to cloud.
VPS hosting margins are down 15-30% in 4 years.

SM Investments in the Philippines already exited the DC business entirely.

Is this a bubble?

It's not black and white.

Singapore (2% vacancy) = NOT a bubble.
Indonesia (strong domestic demand) = Watchful but growing.
Johor (5.8 GW for 3.8M people) = That math doesn't work.

I built an interactive calculator where you can model any SEA market:
- Supply-demand ratio
- Projected 2028 vacancy
- Capital at risk
- Bubble risk score

The infrastructure being built will eventually prove valuable.

But as the fiber-optic crash of 2001 taught us: the infrastructure can be RIGHT while the investment TIMING is catastrophically WRONG.

Building or investing in DC infrastructure in SEA?
I've been in the trenches of DC operations for years.
Happy to discuss the nuances that spreadsheets don't capture.

DM me.
