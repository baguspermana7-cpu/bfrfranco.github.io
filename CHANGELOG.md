# Changelog — ResistanceZero

All notable changes to the ResistanceZero website. Format follows the spirit of
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), with calendar-versioned
release sections rather than semver.

> **Maintenance rule**: Every code or content change shipped to production must
> add an entry here. Entries are grouped by date. Within a date, group by
> `Added`, `Changed`, `Fixed`, `Removed`, `Security`. Cross-reference the
> related standardization document(s) when applicable.

## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- Extract `calc-auth.js` shared engine (Phase 1 of calculator consolidation roadmap, see `standarization/CALC_ENGINE_PLAN.md`).
- Tier 1 legal compliance fixes for articles 19–27 — add cookie banner, independence disclaimer, and terms/privacy footer links per `standarization/LEGAL_COMPLIANCE_STANDARD.md`.
- Hero images for articles 1–19 (currently missing `assets/article-N-hero.webp`).
- References sections for articles 2, 4, 5, 6, 8–12, 14–22 (the older articles still missing references after the 2026-04-28 batch).
- Article-16 `<div class="article-nav">` block (currently missing).

## [2026-04-28] — Glossary Sync, Standards & Calculator Engine Roadmap

### Added
- 21 new glossary entries in `glossary.html` covering articles 23–27 domain
  vocabulary (AIOps, Apprenticeship, BICSI RCDD, Capacity Auction, CDCTP,
  Colossus, DCDC, Digital Twin, Galden HT, Interconnection Queue, Lights-Out
  DC, Maintenance Vapor Release, Megapack, Memphis Turbine Deployment, NOCaaS,
  Novec 7000, PFAS, PJM Interconnection, Reliability Pricing Model, Reserve
  Margin, Spectrum-X, Two-Phase Immersion Cooling). Each entry links back to
  its originating article via `term-links`. Total terms: 300 → 321.
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file) — establishes the maintenance log.
- `standarization/CALC_ENGINE_PLAN.md` — 4-phase consolidation roadmap to
  extract ~5,800 LOC of duplicated auth, login modal, PDF export, and
  Chart.js setup code from 18+ calculator pages into a shared
  `calc-engine.js`. References DCMOC's TypeScript engine pattern as the
  architectural model.
- `standarization/TOOLTIP_STANDARD.md` new section: "Glossary Maintenance
  Workflow" — every new article must add 5+ glossary entries with
  `term-links` back to the article; in-prose first-occurrence terms link to
  `glossary.html#term-[slug]`.
- `standarization/article prompt/ARTICLE_CREATION_PROMPT.md` checklist 9.7:
  glossary update items added.
- Cross-reference notes in `AUTH_STANDARD.md`, `CALCULATOR_PROMPT_STANDARD.md`,
  `PRO_MODE_STANDARDIZATION.md`, and `PDF_EXPORT_STANDARD.md` pointing to
  `CALC_ENGINE_PLAN.md` so future calculator work consults the consolidation
  roadmap before adding more inline duplication.

### Changed
- Expanded existing `term-novec` entry to clarify Novec 1230 vs Novec 7000
  (different products) and added a new `term-novec-7000` entry.

## [2026-04-27] — Article 23–27 References + Standards Update

### Added
- References sections (academic format) for articles 23–27 with 12–25 cited
  primary sources each, linking to Uptime Institute, AFCOM, McKinsey, EPA,
  FERC, NERC, IBEW, NVIDIA, Microsoft, Google, and other authoritative sources.
- `assets/article-27-hero.webp` (1200×509 WebP @ q80, 60 KB).
- `ARTICLE_CREATION_PROMPT.md` §3.8 References pattern (mandatory) and
  checklist 9.6 — closes the standards gap that allowed articles 23–27 to ship
  without references.

### Fixed
- `article-27.html` dark-mode badge classes (12 classes covering CREATE/SUB/
  EXTEND, speed tiers, and cost tiers) now have `[data-theme="dark"]`
  overrides for readability.
- `article-26.html` series-nav next link now points to `article-27.html`.
- `article-24.html` SEO `<title>`, `og:title`, JSON-LD headline, share title,
  and H1 lead with "Data Center Manpower Shortage" for crawler clarity.
- `articles.html` updated with article-27 card, article-24 title fix, and
  structured-data headline updates.

## [2026-04-12] — Article 27 Published

### Added
- `article-27.html` — "No Humans, No Data Centers: 20 Strategies to Solve the
  AI Workforce Crisis" (Global Analysis series, 2,258 lines, ~133 KB).
- Embedded Workforce Strategy Planner calculator: 8 free inputs → 6 KPIs +
  narrative; 4 Pro panels (radar comparison, 36-month HTML Gantt chart,
  year-by-year cost stacked bar, ROI projection line); auth via shared
  session pattern; PDF export via `window.open()`.
- 25 reference citations (academic format).
- Article-27 card on `articles.html` (gradient styling matching Global
  Analysis red).
