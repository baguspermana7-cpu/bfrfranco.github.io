## [2026-04-28e] — Super Engine S2 (workforce + ROI + forecast models) + modal helper

### Added
- **`RZEngine.models.workforce`** — `annualHiresRequired`, `attritionCost`, `strategyFitScore`, `cumulativeHires`, `yearsToCloseGap`. Closed-form math, defaults pulled from `RZEngine.data.attritionFactors` so a single benchmark refresh propagates to every workforce calculator.
- **`RZEngine.models.roi`** — `paybackPeriod`, `npv` (with discount rate), `irr` (bisection over [-0.99, 10]).
- **`RZEngine.models.forecast`** — `compoundGrowth`, `linearTrend` (returns `{slope, intercept, predict}`), `projectByYear` (year-by-year array).
- **`RZEngine.modal.create({id, title, accentColor, subtitle, bodyHTML, submitLabel, onSubmit})`** — singleton modal helper. Auto-injects backdrop with `rgba(0,0,0,0.85)` + `backdrop-filter:blur(8px)` per PRO_MODE standard. Returns `{show, hide, destroy}` controls. Reuses existing element on repeat calls (idempotent).
- Engine bumped to `v1.1.0`.

### Changed
- **article-27 IIFE** now calls `RZEngine.models.workforce.attritionCost(...)` and `RZEngine.models.workforce.annualHiresRequired(...)` for the corresponding KPIs (with hardcoded fallbacks if engine missing). This is the first calculator on the site to share math via the engine, not just constants.

### Verified
- Node smoke tests pass: `annualHiresRequired(25,35,25,5)=9`, `attritionCost(25,25,75100)=$999,769`, `paybackPeriod(100K,30K,5K)=4 yr`, `npv([-100,40×4],0.10)=$26.79`, `compoundGrowth(75100,0.025,5)=$84,969`, `linearTrend(slope=2)`.
- localhost: `rz-engine.js` now `23 KB / 499 LOC` (well under 50 KB budget per SUPER_ENGINE §H).

## [2026-04-28d] — Super Engine S0 + S1 Shipped (skeleton + auth + data + format + events)

### Added
- **`rz-engine.js`** at repo root (~290 LOC, 12 KB unminified, vanilla ES5/ES6, zero deps).
  Implements Phases S0 + S1 of `standarization/SUPER_ENGINE.md`:
  - `RZEngine.data` — single source of truth for `version`, `lastUpdated`, `years` (2025–2030),
    `baselineYear`, `regions` (US/EU/APAC/LATAM with salaryMult/powerKwh/currency),
    `currency`, `inflationAnnual`, `salaryBenchmarks` (dcTechMid, electricianJourneyman, cdfomSenior),
    `attritionFactors` (replacementCostMult, voluntaryAttritionAvg, apprenticeRetention),
    `pueDefaults` (air/liquid/immersion Tier-3 baselines).
  - `RZEngine.auth.{VALID_USERS, validateLogin, getSession, setSession, logout, dispatchAuthChange, onAuthChange}`
    — auth.js-compatible session format, accepts both `{expires:ISOString}` and legacy `{exp:number}`.
  - `RZEngine.format.{currency, percent, number, weeks, months, ymd}` — display helpers.
  - `RZEngine.events.{dispatch, on, off}` — generic CustomEvent bus.
  - Stubs for `RZEngine.{models, modal, pdf, charts, ui}` filled in S2–S6.
- Script tag added to `article-27.html` (after auth.js, before script.min.js) and `article-26.html` (after auth.js).

### Changed
- **article-27 pilot** (S0 first consumer):
  - `wsCheckSession` now delegates to `RZEngine.auth.getSession()` with legacy fallback.
  - `REGION_MULT` and `REGION_LABEL` derived from `RZEngine.data.regions` at IIFE init (with hardcoded fallback if engine missing).
  - `avgSalary` baseline pulled from `RZEngine.data.salaryBenchmarks.dcTechMid.US` ($75,100, was hardcoded $72,000 — refresh to 2024 BLS / Uptime number).
  - `replacementFactor` pulled from `RZEngine.data.attritionFactors.replacementCostMult` (213%).
- Constants are now editable in ONE place (`rz-engine.js`) and propagate to article-27. Future migrations move article-26 + standalone calculators to the same engine in subsequent phases.

### Verified
- Node smoke test: `RZEngine.auth.validateLogin('demo@resistancezero.com','demo2026')` returns `{email, tier:'pro', role:'demo'}`; bad password returns `null`.
- localhost: `art-27=200, art-26=200, rz-engine.js=200 (12KB)`.

## [2026-04-28c] — Modal + Auth Hotfix + Super Engine Design

### Fixed
- article-27 + article-26 modal backdrop now `rgba(0,0,0,0.85)` + `backdrop-filter:blur(8px)` (was `rgba(0,0,0,0.7)` no blur — caused article body to bleed through behind the Pro Analysis modal).
- article-27 IIFE now listens for `rz-auth-change` event so navbar login propagates to the embedded calculator without a page reload. Also fixed a session-format mismatch: IIFE was reading `sess.exp` (numeric timestamp) while `auth.js` writes `sess.expires` (ISOString) — IIFE now accepts both formats. Local IIFE login now writes the auth.js-compatible format and emits `rz-auth-change` so the navbar reflects the login state immediately. (Article-26 already had this listener; only the modal fix applied there.)

### Added
- `standarization/SUPER_ENGINE.md` — master architectural design unifying `CALC_ENGINE_PLAN.md` (plumbing) and `CALC_MODELS_PLAN.md` (math) under a single `window.RZEngine.*` API. Documents the **"Shared Anchor Parameters"** rule: even when a new calculator is custom-built, parameters like Target Year, Region, Currency, Inflation, salary benchmarks, attrition factors, PUE defaults, and power costs MUST be sourced from `RZEngine.data` rather than inlined. Includes 6-phase rollout (~10–11 weeks), versioning discipline, consumer template, DCMOC relationship, failure modes, and 5 open questions for review before S0 starts.
- Cross-references: `CALC_ENGINE_PLAN.md` and `CALC_MODELS_PLAN.md` now declare `SUPER_ENGINE.md` as their parent vision.

## [2026-04-28b] — Article-27 Polish + Calc Models Roadmap

### Fixed
- article-27 dark-mode group-header badges (CREATE/SUBSTITUTE/EXTEND) now have `[data-theme="dark"]` overrides; they were the empty-rectangle badges visible at the top of each strategy group in earlier dark-mode screenshots.

### Changed
- article-27 calculator expanded from 8 → 12 inputs and 7 → 10 KPIs.
  - New inputs: **Target Year (2025–2030)**, **Region (US/EU/APAC/LATAM)**, **Workforce Mix (Physical-heavy/Balanced/NOC-heavy)**, **Risk Tolerance (Conservative/Balanced/Aggressive)**.
  - New KPIs: Annual Hires Required, Cumulative Hires by [Target Year], Years to Close Gap.
  - Cost-related KPIs now scale by region multiplier (US 1.00 / EU 0.85 / APAC 0.45 / LATAM 0.55).
  - 5-Year Investment renamed to N-Year Investment, length driven by Target Year.
  - Narrative auto-references Target Year, Region, Workforce Mix, and Risk Tolerance.
- article-27 added a 5th Pro panel: **Year-by-Year Hiring Trajectory** chart (multi-line: Remaining Staff Gap, Cumulative Hires, Strategy Capacity with maturity ramp).
- article-27 PDF export now includes the new KPIs and Target Year/Region in the header.
- article-27 in-prose first occurrences of `AIOps`, `NOCaaS`, and `apprenticeship` now link to `glossary.html#term-[slug]` per the new glossary workflow.

### Added
- `standarization/CALC_MODELS_PLAN.md` — sibling roadmap to `CALC_ENGINE_PLAN.md` covering the **calculation math layer** (`CalcModels.{workforce, capex, opex, roi, tco, pue, forecast}` plus `CalcModels.data` for shared constants like salary benchmarks, region multipliers, attrition factors). 4-phase rollout. Closes user concern about scattered math without a "big engine" for shared parameters.
- Cross-reference between `CALC_ENGINE_PLAN.md` and `CALC_MODELS_PLAN.md`.

## [2026-04-28] — Glossary Sync, Standards & Calculator Engine Roadmap

### Added
- 21 new glossary entries in `glossary.html` covering articles 23–27 domain
  vocabulary (AIOps, Apprenticeship, BICSI RCDD, Capacity Auction, CDCTP,
  Colossus, DCDC, Digital Twin, Galden HT, Interconnection Queue, Lights-Out
  DC, Maintenance Vapor Release, Megapack, Memphis Turbine Deployment, NOCaaS,
  Novec 7000, PFAS, PJM Interconnection, Reliability Pricing Model, Reserve
  Margin, Spectrum-X, Two-Phase Immersion Cooling). Each entry links back to
  its originating article via `term-links`. Total terms: 300 → 321.
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file) — establishes the maintenance log.
- `standarization/CALC_ENGINE_PLAN.md` — 4-phase consolidation roadmap to
  extract ~5,800 LOC of duplicated auth, login modal, PDF export, and
  Chart.js setup code from 18+ calculator pages into a shared
  `calc-engine.js`. References DCMOC's TypeScript engine pattern as the
  architectural model.
- `standarization/TOOLTIP_STANDARD.md` new section: "Glossary Maintenance
  Workflow" — every new article must add 5+ glossary entries with
  `term-links` back to the article; in-prose first-occurrence terms link to
  `glossary.html#term-[slug]`.
- `standarization/article prompt/ARTICLE_CREATION_PROMPT.md` checklist 9.7:
  glossary update items added.
- Cross-reference notes in `AUTH_STANDARD.md`, `CALCULATOR_PROMPT_STANDARD.md`,
  `PRO_MODE_STANDARDIZATION.md`, and `PDF_EXPORT_STANDARD.md` pointing to
  `CALC_ENGINE_PLAN.md` so future calculator work consults the consolidation
  roadmap before adding more inline duplication.

### Changed
- Expanded existing `term-novec` entry to clarify Novec 1230 vs Novec 7000
  (different products) and added a new `term-novec-7000` entry.

## [2026-04-27] — Article 23–27 References + Standards Update

### Added
- References sections (academic format) for articles 23–27 with 12–25 cited
  primary sources each, linking to Uptime Institute, AFCOM, McKinsey, EPA,
  FERC, NERC, IBEW, NVIDIA, Microsoft, Google, and other authoritative sources.
- `assets/article-27-hero.webp` (1200×509 WebP @ q80, 60 KB).
- `ARTICLE_CREATION_PROMPT.md` §3.8 References pattern (mandatory) and
  checklist 9.6 — closes the standards gap that allowed articles 23–27 to ship
  without references.

### Fixed
- `article-27.html` dark-mode badge classes (12 classes covering CREATE/SUB/
  EXTEND, speed tiers, and cost tiers) now have `[data-theme="dark"]`
  overrides for readability.
- `article-26.html` series-nav next link now points to `article-27.html`.
- `article-24.html` SEO `<title>`, `og:title`, JSON-LD headline, share title,
  and H1 lead with "Data Center Manpower Shortage" for crawler clarity.
- `articles.html` updated with article-27 card, article-24 title fix, and
  structured-data headline updates.

---

## [2026-04-12] — Article 27 Published

### Added
- `article-27.html` — "No Humans, No Data Centers: 20 Strategies to Solve the
  AI Workforce Crisis" (Global Analysis series, 2,258 lines, ~133 KB).
- Embedded Workforce Strategy Planner calculator: 8 free inputs → 6 KPIs +
  narrative; 4 Pro panels (radar comparison, 36-month HTML Gantt chart,
  year-by-year cost stacked bar, ROI projection line); auth via shared
  session pattern; PDF export via `window.open()`.
- 25 reference citations (academic format).
- Article-27 card on `articles.html` (gradient styling matching Global
  Analysis red).
