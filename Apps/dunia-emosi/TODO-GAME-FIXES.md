## ✅ COMPLETED 2026-04-20

### G22 Monster Wants Candy — Pokeball Category Visual Match
- ✅ **Ball visual = category**: Ball design indexed by `ballType` (not random) — Poké Ball=Math, Great Ball=Warna, Ultra Ball=Hewan, Master Ball=Buah, etc. Ball color now signals quiz domain.
- ✅ **Category chip**: Quiz panel shows `🎯 Matematika / Warna / Hewan / Buah` label above question so player knows what they're answering.
- ✅ **Text question fix**: Quiz label no longer appends `= ?` to non-numeric questions (e.g., "Apa warna langit?" not "Apa warna langit? = ?").
- ✅ **Panel enlarged**: Quiz panel BG expanded to fit category chip without overlap.

### Train BGM (G14/G15/G16)
- ✅ **Train BGM wired**: Renamed `WhatsApp Audio ...mp3` to `Sounds/train-bgm.mp3` and swapped all 3 train games to use it instead of `battle-bgm.mp3` (Pokemon battle theme).
- Files: `games/g14.html`, `games/g15-pixi.html`, `games/g16-pixi.html`

### G10/G11/G12 Scoring — Double Normalization Fix
- ✅ **Root cause**: `endGame()` normalized raw star count to 5-star scale, then `showResult()` normalized AGAIN using `maxPossibleStars` set to raw `maxRounds`. For Lv.10 (6 rounds) perfect run: `round(6/6*5)=5` in endGame → `round(5/6*5)=4` in showResult ❌
- ✅ **Fix**: `endGame()` now sets `state.maxPossibleStars=5` (already-normalized scale) so showResult does `round(N/5*5)=N` and passes the correct value through.
- **Impact**: Perfect runs on any level now correctly show 5★ instead of 4★ or fewer.

### G18 Museum Kereta — +5 Indonesian Trains
- ✅ **Lori Tebu (1880)**: 60cm narrow-gauge sugar cane plantation train (Sragi, Tasikmadu, Colomadu)
- ✅ **CC201 (1977, GE USA)**: Iconic orange diesel locomotive — 140+ units in Indonesia
- ✅ **Whoosh KCIC400AF (2023)**: First HSR in Southeast Asia — Jakarta→Bandung 45 min
- ✅ **Argo Parahyangan (2010, INKA Madiun)**: Executive Jakarta-Bandung — showcases Indonesian INKA manufacturing
- ✅ **LRT Jabodebek (2023)**: First driverless (GoA L3) train in Indonesia
- Total trains: 19 → 24

### G22 Real Pokeball PNGs
- ✅ **SVG → PNG rasterization**: ImageMagick `-density 300 -resize 128x128` produced 9 PNGs (19-29KB each) in `assets/Pokemon/pokeballs-png/`.
- ✅ **PIXI.Assets.load()**: `preloadPokeballTextures()` fires during init, caches by ballType index.
- ✅ **Sprite render**: `spawnCandy` uses `PIXI.Sprite(cachedTex)` when available, falls back to drawn Graphics otherwise.
- Result: real authentic pokeball art (proper stripes, shading) replaces the drawn primitives.

### G6 Petualangan Mobil — Road Polish
- ✅ **Yellow center dash**: Middle lane divider now `#FCD34D` alpha 0.55+ (was faint white 0.08) — classic highway look.
- ✅ **Road signs**: Spawner emits 3-5s cadence post + icon-boxed sign on random side, themed per map (city=🛑🚸🅿️, forest=🦌🌳, space=🛸🌠, pantai=🏖️🌊, sekolah=📚🏫, dapur=🍳🧂, kebun=🌻🌾, body=💊🧬). Scrolls with road speed, auto-culled off-screen.

### G17 Jembatan Goyang — Juice
- ✅ **Lives display**: ❤️❤️❤️ in HUD top-right, fills 🖤 as damage taken, shakes on hit via `g17HeartShake` keyframe.
- ✅ **Floating numbers**: Red `-1 💔` on damage, gold `+1 ⭐` on correct tap, larger gold `COMBO xN!` on 3+ streak. Float-up animation `g17FloatUp` with scale + fade.
- Addresses "gameplay sangat jelek" — whack-a-mole now has feedback loop.

### G14 Balapan Kereta — Scenery Detail
- ✅ **Bird flock**: 3-bird V-silhouette with wing-flap scaleY oscillation, drifts left (only forest/coastal/snow themes where it fits).
- ✅ **Signal posts**: 4 alternating red/green LED posts with soft glow, scroll at 0.6× train speed as mid-layer parallax.
- Addresses "sparse, lacks detail" — all scenery depths now have movement.

## ✅ COMPLETED 2026-04-20 — G3 Huruf Hutan AAA Overhaul

- ✅ **Background**: Switched from `bg-game3-huruf.webp` (bedroom-like overlay) to `bg-forest.webp`
- ✅ **Word display**: Wooden plank style — amber/brown gradient with wood-grain stripes, white text with shadow, `#D97706` border, `#451A03` drop shadow
- ✅ **Letter spans**: Word rendered per-character; first letter is blank `_` (fill-in-the-blank puzzle)
- ✅ **Letter highlight**: On correct answer, blank fills with correct letter + gold `#FCD34D` burst animation (`g3LetterBurst` scale 1.6×)
- ✅ **Hint speech bubble**: White pill with green border `#86EFAC`, soft shadow, readable dark-green text
- ✅ **Choice buttons**: Carved wood log style — deep brown gradient `#7C2D12→#9A3412`, vertical wood-grain, orange border `#FB923C`, cream yellow letters, bouncy press
- ✅ **Animal swing**: Gentle 3s hover animation — rotate -3°↔3° + translateY ±10px
- ✅ **Mode badge hidden**: `display:none` (redundant with mascot guide bubble)
- ✅ **Progress text hidden**: `display:none` on "1/6" (keeping only round-dots at top)

## ⬜ PENDING FIXES — BY GAME

### G6 — Petualangan Mobil (Car Letter Collection)
- ✅ **BGM**: Code already reverted to `battle-bgm.mp3` — user needs cache clear
- ✅ **Floating emoji buildings**: Reduced to 8 items, smaller (14-20px), much lower opacity (0.2-0.35), less distracting
- ✅ **Vehicle images empty**: Fixed URL encoding — spaces in path `car and vehicle` → `car%20and%20vehicle`
- ✅ **Buttons**: Removed ⬅️➡️ emoji arrows — now just text "Kiri" / "Kanan" with pastel purple styling
- ⬜ **Overall visual quality**: Road, environment, obstacles need more detail and polish

### G9 — Jejak Huruf (Letter Tracing)
- ✅ **Tracing works**: Code verified — tracing IS plotting (visible in screenshot). Fixed spawnSparkles to pass star count
- ✅ **Background**: Replaced ugly bg-game9-trace.webp with clean green gradient (light: mint→green, dark: deep forest green)
- ✅ **Canvas styling**: Responsive width (min 300px/80vw), warm cream background, softer border, better shadow
- ✅ **Guide dot polish**: Added pulsing glow animation, larger dots (20px), better hit feedback with glow

### G14 — Balapan Kereta (Train Race)
- ✅ **BGM**: Wired `train-bgm.mp3` (was `battle-bgm.mp3`)
- ⬜ **Background/environment**: Very sparse, lacks detail, "gambar2 nggak jelas" (unclear images)
- ✅ **Buttons**: Removed emoji arrows (⬆️⬇️🚀), clean text only "Atas"/"Bawah"/"BOOST!" with pastel styling
- ⬜ **Visual enhancement**: Train sprites, track, scenery all need more detail

### G15 — Lokomotif Pemberani
- ✅ **BGM**: Wired `train-bgm.mp3`
- ✅ **Train selection UI**: Cards enlarged (68→110px min, up to 150px on desktop), rounded corners, hover effects, bigger text (8→10px names, 6→7px subs), better spacing (gap 3→8px, padding increased)
- ⬜ **Visual enhancement**: Overall gameplay visuals

### G16 — Selamatkan Kereta (Signal Rush)
- ✅ **BGM**: Wired `train-bgm.mp3`
- ✅ **Boost effect removed**: `clearObstacle()` now sets MOVING instead of BOOSTING — no more speed burst after quiz
- ⬜ **Visual/animation enhancement**: More visual effects, better animations

### G17 — Jembatan Goyang
- ✅ **banner-game17.webp**: Generated via Gemini API
- ✅ **banner-game18.webp**: Generated via Gemini API
- ⬜ **Gameplay revamp**: User says "gameplay sangat jelek" — needs visual, UI/UX, mechanics, animation overhaul

### G18 — Museum Kereta Ambarawa
- ✅ **Train catalog expansion**: +5 Indonesian trains added (19→24). CC201, Whoosh KCIC, Argo Parahyangan, LRT Jabodebek, plus Lori Tebu.
- ✅ **Add lorry/tebu trains**: Lori Tebu (1880, Orenstein & Koppel, 60cm narrow gauge) included.
- ✅ **Story button**: Added "📖 Cerita" button in train detail modal — generates child-friendly story from train data (year, speed, fuel, builder, route). Toggleable panel with scrollable content.
- ⬜ **Gameplay/mechanics development**: More interactive elements

### G19 — Pokemon Birds
- ✅ **Icon**: Replaced 🐦 emoji with Pidgeot sprite in game-badge + Pidgeot GIF in start-overlay + level select (iconImg)
- ✅ **Banner**: Generated banner-game19.webp via Gemini API (+ G20, G22 banners too)
- ✅ **Sprite centering**: Changed from manual left/top offset to `transform:translate(-50%,-50%)` — image always centered in hitbox circle regardless of aspect ratio
- ⬜ **GIF quality**: Some GIFs have artifacts — white areas became transparent, tracing remnants visible. Mirror/ GIFs already applied but some may still have issues

### G22 — Monster Wants Candy (MAJOR REVAMP)
- 🔧 **Real pokeball SVGs**: SVGs not rendering — PixiJS v8 may not load SVG via Sprite.from(). Need to use PIXI.Assets.load() or convert to PNG. Falling back to Graphics for now with distinct colors per ball type.
- ⬜ **Quiz engine**: Don't create inline questions. Use shared question bank (300+ questions in game.js). Build shared quiz engine that G22 and other games can use. Categories: math (easy), bahasa, sains, etc.
- ✅ **No multiplication/division**: Verified — QS bank only has + and - operations
- ✅ **Monster → Psyduck**: Replaced broken monster icon with HD Psyduck sprite (pokemondb.net), local fallback
- ✅ **Pokemon picker in pause menu**: Added 15 Pokemon grid (Psyduck, Pikachu, Eevee, Snorlax, etc). HD sprites from pokemondb. Switching changes catcher character instantly.
- ✅ **Different pokeball = different category**: Ball design now indexed by `ballType` — Poké Ball=Math, Great Ball=Warna, Ultra Ball=Hewan, Master Ball=Buah. Quiz panel shows category chip.
- ✅ **Physics smoothed**: Added sinusoidal wobble/sway to falling pokeballs, tighter speed range
- ⬜ **Visual/UI very ugly**: Overall look and navigation needs major improvement — compare against original source
- ⬜ **Navigation flow**: Menu, pause, game flow needs redesign to feel polished

### G10 — Pertarungan Pokemon
- ✅ **Platform/pedestal**: Made CSS `.g10-oval` more visible — brown color, border, larger size (110x22px)
- ✅ **HD sprites restored**: Reverted from local-first (96px) back to HD-online-first (pokemondb 200-300px) with local fallback
- ✅ **Hit effect**: Code exists (spr-hit, spr-flash, g10EHitFlip animations) — should be visible now with HD sprites
- ✅ **WebGL context lost freeze**: Fixed — `backToLevelSelect()` now calls `PixiManager.destroyAll()` to free WebGL context before returning to level select.
- ✅ **Scoring fixed**: Double-normalization bug — `endGame()` normalized to 5-star, then `showResult()` re-normalized using raw `maxRounds`. Fixed by setting `state.maxPossibleStars=5` so showResult passes through.
- ✅ **CRITICAL: Result modal frozen**: Fixed — `showResult()` now closes overlay-feedback and game-result-overlay before showing screen-result. Overlays were blocking button clicks.
- ⬜ **Unified modal engine**: User wants inline game result + standalone GameModal to share same engine. Currently two separate systems — `showResult()` in game.js for G1-G12, `GameModal.show()` in game-modal.js for standalone games.
- ✅ **Shared pause menu engine**: Built `GamePause` in game-modal.js — `GamePause.init({onResume, onRetry, onHome, bgmEl})`, `GamePause.show()/hide()`. Has master+BGM volume sliders, resume/retry/home buttons. Games can import and use.
- ⬜ **Migrate games to GamePause**: Standalone games still have their own pause overlays — migrate to shared engine one by one

### G20 — Ducky Volley
- ⬜ **Mobile testing**: User said they'd test on mobile and give feedback — awaiting

---

### G10 — Pertarungan Pokemon (continued)
- ✅ **Scoring**: G19 migrated to GameScoring.calc(). G10 endGame() correct.
- ✅ **G13 scoring bug**: showGameResult used `_g13stars` (1-3 tier) instead of `perfStars` (1-5 display). Perfect evolution now shows 5★ correctly.

## ⬜ CROSS-GAME ISSUES

### Unified Scoring Engine
- ✅ **Built `GameScoring.calc()`** in `game-modal.js` — shared algorithm: accuracy-based (100%=5★, 85%=4★, 65%=3★, 40%=2★), with modifiers for wrong answers, lives, time, bonus
- ✅ **Standalone games migrated**: G6, G14, G15, G16, G19, G20, G22 all use `GameScoring.calc()`
- ✅ **Inline games**: addStars() now passes star count to spawnSparkles() for grading. showResult() already has graded confetti. Feedback overlay confetti only fires for 3+ stars.

### BGM Audit
- ⬜ **Find/identify train BGM**: User says they provided train-specific BGM previously. Check `Sounds/` directory and conversation history. The `WhatsApp Audio` file in Sounds/ might be it.
- ⬜ **Assign correct BGM per game type**:
  - Pokemon battle games (G10, G13, G13b, G13c): Pokemon themes ✅
  - Train games (G14, G15, G16): Train BGM (TBD)
  - Car game (G6): Appropriate non-Pokemon BGM
  - Bird game (G19): bgm-odd/bgm-even ✅
  - Volleyball (G20): Pokemon Opening ✅
  - Candy (G22): battle-bgm.mp3 (NOT Pokemon BGM) ✅

### Missing Banner Assets
- ✅ Generated ALL 6 missing banners via Gemini 2.5 Flash Image API: banner-game13 through banner-game18.webp
- **Gemini API key for image gen**: `AIzaSyDtZO2nB_lk4NaAFObh3Dksl8R55TIt_AI`

---

## NOTES
- G6 code already has `battle-bgm.mp3` — if user still hears Pokemon BGM, it's browser cache
- G14/G15/G16 also already reverted in code — cache issue
- Train BGM: user mentioned providing it before but only `battle-bgm.mp3` and `WhatsApp Audio` exist in `Sounds/`
- G13c trainer image 404s are expected (fallback chain: local → remote CDN → emoji initial)
